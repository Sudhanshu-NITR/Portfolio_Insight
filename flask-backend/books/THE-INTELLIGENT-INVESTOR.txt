Preface to the Fourth Edition,

by Warren E. Buffett

I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine-

teen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing
ever written. I still think it is.

   To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-
spheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.
What's needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-
sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-
work. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper
framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.

   If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra-
ham advocates--and if you pay special attention to the invaluable
advice in Chapters 8 and 20--you will not get a poor result from
your investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment
than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results
will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-
ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-
vail during your investing career. The sillier the market's behavior,
the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow
Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.

   To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher.
More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.
Shortly after Ben's death in 1976, I wrote the following short
remembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you
read the book, I believe you'll perceive some of the qualities I men-
tioned in this tribute.

ix  Preface to the Fourth Edition

                            BENJAMIN GRAHAM

                                     1894­1976

    Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend
the thought that he hoped every day to do "something foolish, something
creative and something generous."

    The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-
aging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or
self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was
unfailingly gentle.

    Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as
measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-
pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.
But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure
and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-
sible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security
analysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months
after publication, Ben's principles have remained sound--their value often
enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that
demolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness
brought unfailing rewards to his followers--even to those with natural
abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-
ing counsels of brilliance or fashion.

    A remarkable aspect of Ben's dominance of his professional field was
that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-
trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of
an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have
never met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,
unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a
form applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his
thinking in any field a delight.

    But his third imperative--generosity--was where he succeeded beyond
all others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each
relationship--just as with all his students, employees, and friends--there
was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,
and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to
go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.

    Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit
under. Ben Graham was such a man.

  A Note About Benjamin Graham

  by Jason Zweig

 Who was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?

       Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was
    also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,
    money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by
    superstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham's Security Analysis
    was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-
    fession.1

       And The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for
    individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that
    are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on
    investing ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor
    was the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub
    reporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham's certainty that, sooner
    or later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-
    fered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,
    after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market
    that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more prophet-
    ically than ever.)

       Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the
    anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and
    psychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on
    May 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and
    figurines.2 The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At
    first they lived the good life--with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-

    1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.
    2 The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,
    when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.

erness--on upper Fifth Avenue. But Ben's father died in 1903, the
porcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.
Ben's mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-
ing money to trade stocks "on margin," she was wiped out in the crash
of 1907. For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of
cashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, "Is
Dorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?"

   Fortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his
brilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his
class. Before the end of Graham's final semester, three departments--
English, philosophy, and mathematics--asked him to join the faculty.
He was all of 20 years old.

   Instead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.
He started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,
then a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-
nership.

   The Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In
April 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for
Savold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by
October, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock
was worthless.

   Graham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,
almost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure
reports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-
mission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.--then trading at $65
per share--held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He
bought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and
came away with $110 per share three years later.)

   Despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of
1929­1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting
bargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact
record of Graham's earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in
1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,
versus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole--one of the best long-
term track records on Wall Street history.3

3 Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)
that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his
own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new investors. I am
A Note About Benjamin Graham  xii

   How did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual
powers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham
developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they
were during his lifetime:

· A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an
     ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value
     that does not depend on its share price.

· The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-
     able optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified
     pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor
     is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.

· The future value of every investment is a function of its present
     price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.

· No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever
     eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what
     Graham called the "margin of safety"--never overpaying, no mat-
     ter how exciting an investment seems to be--can you minimize
     your odds of error.

· The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you
     become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street "fact" on faith,
     and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady
     advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your
     discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people's mood
     swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-
     ments behave is much less important than how you behave.

   The goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investor is to apply
Graham's ideas to today's financial markets while leaving his text
entirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4 After
each of Graham's chapters you'll find a new commentary. In these
reader's guides, I've added recent examples that should show you just
how relevant--and how liberating--Graham's principles remain today.

grateful to Walter Schloss for providing data essential to estimating
Graham-Newman's returns. The 20% annual average return that Graham
cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take management fees into
account.

xiii  A Note About Benjamin Graham

         I envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading Graham's
      masterpiece for the first time--or even the third or fourth time. Like all
      classics, it alters how we view the world and renews itself by educat-
      ing us. And the more you read it, the better it gets. With Graham as
      your guide, you are guaranteed to become a vastly more intelligent
      investor.
INTRODUCTION:

What This Book Expects to Accomplish

The purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for lay-

men, guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment pol-
icy. Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of
analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment
principles and investors' attitudes. We shall, however, provide a
number of condensed comparisons of specific securities--chiefly in
pairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list--
in order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements
involved in specific choices of common stocks.

   But much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns
of financial markets, in some cases running back over many
decades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-
armed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of
bonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-
tions--some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one's
own experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to
Wall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: "Those who do
not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

   Our text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-
tors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all
but forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a
"how to make a million" book. There are no sure and easy paths to
riches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up
what we have just said by a bit of financial history--especially
since there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-
mactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally
as well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an
article in the Ladies' Home Journal, entitled "Everybody Ought to Be

                                                                                               1

Rich."* His thesis was that savings of only $15 per month invested
in good common stocks--with dividends reinvested--would pro-
duce an estate of $80,000 in twenty years against total contributions
of only $3,600. If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was
indeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our
rough calculation--based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks
making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)--indicates
that if Raskob's prescription had been followed during 1929­1948,
the investor's holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been
worth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man's promise
of $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such
optimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should
remark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation
would have been better than 8% compounded annually--and this
despite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases
with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948
closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive
argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong
common stocks through thick and thin--a program known as
"dollar-cost averaging."

   Since our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant
for those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided
by charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the
right moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to
nearly all these so-called "technical approaches" is that one should
buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell
because it has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business
sense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to

* Raskob (1879­1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-
pany, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He also
served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the driving
force behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by
finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob's plan would have
grown to just under $9,000 after 20 years, although inflation would have
eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent look at Raskob's views on
long-term stock investing, see the essay by financial adviser William Bern-
stein at www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.

lasting success on Wall Street. In our own stock-market experience
and observation, extending over 50 years, we have not known a
single person who has consistently or lastingly made money by
thus "following the market." We do not hesitate to declare that this
approach is as fallacious as it is popular. We shall illustrate what
we have just said--though, of course this should not be taken as
proof--by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow theory for
trading in the stock market.*

   Since its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent
Investor have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In
updating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a
number of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.
These include:

1. An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade
     bonds.

2. A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common
     stocks, ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage
     decline in some 30 years. (Countless issues of lower quality
     had a much larger shrinkage.)

3. A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer's prices,
     which gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-
     eral business in 1970.

4. The rapid development of "conglomerate" companies, fran-
     chise operations, and other relative novelties in business and
     finance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as "let-
     ter stock,"1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading
     names, use of foreign banks, and others.)

* Graham's "brief discussion" is in two parts, on p. 33 and pp. 191­192.
For more detail on the Dow Theory, see http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/
dow/dowpage.html.
 Mutual funds bought "letter stock" in private transactions, then immedi-
ately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham's definition
on p. 579). That enabled these "go-go" funds to report unsustainably high
returns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund
investors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.
4  Introduction

5. Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-
     term debt of many formerly strongly entrenched companies,
     and even a disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street
     houses.*

6. The advent of the "performance" vogue in the management of
     investment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,
     with disquieting results.

   These phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some
will require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-
ous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should
not alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-
ples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-
nisms and climate.

   The last statement was put to the test during the writing of the
present edition, the first draft of which was finished in January
1971. At that time the DJIA was in a strong recovery from its 1970
low of 632 and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with
attendant general optimism. As the last draft was finished, in
November 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-
rying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its
future. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general
attitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-
tially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.

   The extent of the market's shrinkage in 1969­70 should have
served to dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground dur-
ing the past two decades. This was that leading common stocks
could be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not
only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon
be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-

* The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in the
United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970--shocking
investors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see
p. 423). Among the companies with "excessive" debt Graham had in mind
were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see pp. 425 and
463). The "problem of solvency" on Wall Street emerged between 1968
and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went bust.
What This Book Expects to Accomplish  5

els. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has
"returned to normal," in the sense that both speculators and stock
investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-
haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.

   In the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,
especially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the
last market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in
itself--it had happened to a similar degree in 1961­62--but there
was now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment
funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously
overvalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who
needs to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for
great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-
ably leads to disaster.

   The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the
huge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967
the investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much
income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-
tive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%
on highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.
(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of
1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949
the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only
2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2 In previous editions we have
consistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor's
portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general
a 50­50 division between the two media. We must now consider
whether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock
yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-
tionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-
tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision
here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*

* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-
ing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all that
different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generated
by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.
6  Introduction

   In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds
of investors to whom this book was addressed--the "defensive"
and the "enterprising." The defensive (or passive) investor will
place his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or
losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and
the need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of
the enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness
to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
sound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades
an enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile
reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average
return than that realized by the passive investor. We have some
doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to
the active investor under today's conditions. But next year or the
years after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to
devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as
they existed in former periods and may return.

   It has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-
ful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that
are most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the
most promising companies in these industries. For example, smart
investors--or their smart advisers--would long ago have recog-
nized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a
whole and of International Business Machines in particular. And
similarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-
panies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To
bring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that
we included first in the 1949 edition of this book.

       Such an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport
   stocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than
   the trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the
   value of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls
   lurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive
   technique that will help him along his path.*

* "Air-transport stocks," of course, generated as much excitement in the late
1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later. Among
the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical Securities and the
What This Book Expects to Accomplish  7

   The pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry
we mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of
air traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this
factor their shares became a favorite choice of the investment
funds. But despite the expansion of revenues--at a pace even
greater than in the computer industry--a combination of techno-
logical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-
ing and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a
new high in traffic figures, the airlines sustained a loss of some
$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in
1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a
greater decline in 1969­70 than did the general market. The record
shows that even the highly paid full-time experts of the mutual
funds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of
a major and nonesoteric industry.

   On the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial
investments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its
apparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about
its rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%
of their funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of
this excellent choice on their overall results was by no means
decisive. Furthermore, many--if not most--of their investments in
computer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been
unprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals
for our readers:

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
     translate into obvious profits for investors.

2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and
     concentrating on the most promising companies in the most
     promising industries.

Missiles-Rockets-Jets & Automation Fund. They, like the stocks they owned,
turned out to be an investing disaster. It is commonly accepted today that
the cumulative earnings of the airline industry over its entire history have
been negative. The lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid
buying airline stocks, but that you should never succumb to the "certainty"
that any industry will outperform all others in the future.
8  Introduction

   The author did not follow this approach in his financial career as
fund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much
encouragement to those who may wish to try it.

   What then will we aim to accomplish in this book? Our main
objective will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible
substantial error and to develop policies with which he will be
comfortable. We shall say quite a bit about the psychology of
investors. For indeed, the investor's chief problem--and even his
worst enemy--is likely to be himself. ("The fault, dear investor, is
not in our stars--and not in our stocks--but in ourselves. . . .") This
has proved the more true over recent decades as it has become
more necessary for conservative investors to acquire common
stocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement
and the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,
and exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper
mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.
We have seen much more money made and kept by "ordinary peo-
ple" who were temperamentally well suited for the investment
process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they
had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-
market lore.

   Additionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to
measure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at
some price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price
they would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-
ing what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in
investment. In an article in a women's magazine many years ago
we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-
ceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses
of the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were
realized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to
ask "How much?"

   In June 1970 the question "How much?" could be answered by
the magic figure 9.40%--the yield obtainable on new offerings of
high-grade public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about
7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, "Why give any other
answer?" But there are other possible answers, and these must be
carefully considered. Besides which, we repeat that both we and
our readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif-
ferent conditions of, say, 1973­1977.
What This Book Expects to Accomplish  9

   We shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for
common-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of
both classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter-
prising group. Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our
chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues
selling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for
this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-
cal. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good
growth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of
such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations
of the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of
public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always
consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding
businesses, acquired at a rational price--regardless of what the
stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such
a conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting
adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated
growth.

   The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally
appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved
by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to
improve this easily attainable standard requires much application
and more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a
little extra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment
program, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you
may well find that you have done worse.

   Since anyone--by just buying and holding a representative
list--can equal the performance of the market averages, it would
seem a comparatively simple matter to "beat the averages"; but as
a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail
is surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds,
with all their experienced personnel, have not performed so well

* Tangible assets include a company's physical property (like real estate,
factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (such
as cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable). Among the ele-
ments not included in tangible assets are brands, copyrights, patents, fran-
chises, goodwill, and trademarks. To see how to calculate tangible-asset
value, see footnote  on p. 198.
10  Introduction

over the years as has the general market. Allied to the foregoing
is the record of the published stock-market predictions of the
brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated
forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing
of a coin.

   In writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of
investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have
been emphasized--the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-
sified list of leading common stocks--which any investor can carry
out with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe
and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-
ing difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before
attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself
and of his advisers--particularly as to whether they have a clear
concept of the differences between investment and speculation and
between market price and underlying value.

   A strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the
margin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a
decision to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured
fruits of defensive investment should not be made without much
self-examination.

   A final retrospective thought. When the young author entered
Wall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next
half-century had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect
that a World War was to break out in two months, and close down
the New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the
richest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sorts
of major problems and more apprehensive than confident of the
future. Yet if we confine our attention to American investment
experience, there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last 57
years. Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-
shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound
investment principles produced generally sound results. We must
act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.

   Note to the Reader: This book does not address itself to the overall
financial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that
portion of their funds which they are prepared to place in mar-
ketable (or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks.
What This Book Expects to Accomplish  11

Consequently we do not discuss such important media as savings
and time desposits, savings-and-loan-association accounts, life
insurance, annuities, and real-estate mortgages or equity owner-
ship. The reader should bear in mind that when he finds the word
"now," or the equivalent, in the text, it refers to late 1971 or
early 1972.
COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION

   If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;
   that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under
   them.

                                            --Henry David Thoreau, Walden

Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not

tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.
   Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:

· how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;
· how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;
· how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most

     investors from reaching their full potential.

   Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks
seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could
lose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,
many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value
or more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%
just to get back to where you started.1 Taking a foolish risk can put
you so deep in the hole that it's virtually impossible to get out. That's
why Graham constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding
losses--not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-
ing that he has woven throughout his entire text.

   But no matter how careful you are, the price of your investments
will go down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,

1 To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are likely to
buy a stock at $30 and be able to sell it at $600.

Graham will show you how to manage it--and how to get your fears
under control.

AR E YOU AN I NTE LLIG E NT I NVE STOR?

Now let's answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-
ham mean by an "intelligent" investor? Back in the first edition of this
book, Graham defines the term--and he makes it clear that this kind of
intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means
being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to
harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,
explains Graham, "is a trait more of the character than of the brain." 2

   There's proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to
make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management
L.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer
scientists, and two Nobel Prize­winning economists, lost more than
$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market
would return to "normal." But the bond market kept right on becoming
more and more abnormal--and LTCM had borrowed so much money
that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3

   And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in
the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that
the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that
he "could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the
madness of the people." Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-
eting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in
the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much
higher price--and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today's
money). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words
"South Sea" in his presence.4

invested aggressively for wealthy clients. For a superb telling of the LTCM
story, see Roger Lowenstein, When Genius Failed (Random House, 2000).

14  Commentary on the Introduction

   Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever
lived, as most of us would define intelligence. But, in Graham's terms,
Newton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the
crowd override his own judgment, the world's greatest scientist acted
like a fool.

   In short, if you've failed at investing so far, it's not because you're
stupid. It's because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven't developed the
emotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,
Graham describes how to enhance your intelligence by harnessing
your emotions and refusing to stoop to the market's level of irrational-
ity. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is
more a matter of "character" than "brain."

A CHRONICLE OF CALAMITY

Now let's take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-
opments of the past few years:

1. The worst market crash since the Great Depression, with U.S.
     stocks losing 50.2% of their value--or $7.4 trillion--between
     March 2000 and October 2002.

2. Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of
     the 1990s, including AOL, Cisco, JDS Uniphase, Lucent, and
     Qualcomm--plus the utter destruction of hundreds of Internet
     stocks.

3. Accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest and
     most respected corporations in America, including Enron, Tyco,
     and Xerox.

4. The bankruptcies of such once-glistening companies as Con-
     seco, Global Crossing, and WorldCom.

5. Allegations that accounting firms cooked the books, and even
     destroyed records, to help their clients mislead the investing public.

6. Charges that top executives at leading companies siphoned off
     hundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain.

7. Proof that security analysts on Wall Street praised stocks publicly
     but admitted privately that they were garbage.

8. A stock market that, even after its bloodcurdling decline, seems
     overvalued by historical measures, suggesting to many experts
     that stocks have further yet to fall.
Commentary on the Introduction  15

 9. A relentless decline in interest rates that has left investors with no
     attractive alternative to stocks.

10. An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace
     of global terrorism and war in the Middle East.

   Much of this damage could have been (and was!) avoided by
investors who learned and lived by Graham's principles. As Graham
puts it, "while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplish-
ments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster."
By letting themselves get carried away--on Internet stocks, on big
"growth" stocks, on stocks as a whole--many people made the same
stupid mistakes as Sir Isaac Newton. They let other investors' judg-
ments determine their own. They ignored Graham's warning that "the
really dreadful losses" always occur after "the buyer forgot to ask
`How much?' " Most painfully of all, by losing their self-control just
when they needed it the most, these people proved Graham's asser-
tion that "the investor's chief problem--and even his worst enemy--is
likely to be himself."

TH E S U R E TH I N G THAT WAS N'T

Many of those people got especially carried away on technology and
Internet stocks, believing the high-tech hype that this industry would
keep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:

· In mid-1999, after earning a 117.3% return in just the first five
     months of the year, Monument Internet Fund portfolio manager
     Alexander Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year
     over the next three to five years and an annual average of 35%
     "over the next 20 years." 5

5 Constance Loizos, "Q&A: Alex Cheung," InvestmentNews, May 17, 1999,
p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history was 25.8% per year,
achieved by the legendary Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan over the two
decades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch's performance turned $10,000
into more than $982,000 in 20 years. Cheung was predicting that his fund
would turn $10,000 into more than $4 million over the same length of time.
Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously overoptimistic, investors threw
16  Commentary on the Introduction

· After his Amerindo Technology Fund rose an incredible 248.9%
     in 1999, portfolio manager Alberto Vilar ridiculed anyone who
     dared to doubt that the Internet was a perpetual moneymaking
     machine: "If you're out of this sector, you're going to underper-
     form. You're in a horse and buggy, and I'm in a Porsche. You
     don't like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone
     else." 6

· In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer pro-
     claimed that Internet-related companies "are the only ones worth
     owning right now." These "winners of the new world," as he called
     them, "are the only ones that are going higher consistently in
     good days and bad." Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: "You
     have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that
     existed before the Web. . . . If we used any of what Graham and
     Dodd teach us, we wouldn't have a dime under management." 7

   All these so-called experts ignored Graham's sober words of warn-
ing: "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
translate into obvious profits for investors." While it seems easy to
foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real
value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By
the time everyone decides that a given industry is "obviously" the best

money at him, flinging more than $100 million into his fund over the next
year. A $10,000 investment in the Monument Internet Fund in May 1999
would have shrunk to roughly $2,000 by year-end 2002. (The Monument
fund no longer exists in its original form and is now known as Orbitex
Emerging Technology Fund.)
6 Lisa Reilly Cullen, "The Triple Digit Club," Money, December, 1999, p. 170.
If you had invested $10,000 in Vilar's fund at the end of 1999, you would
have finished 2002 with just $1,195 left--one of the worst destructions of
wealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.
7 See www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html. Cramer's favorite
stocks did not go "higher consistently in good days and bad." By year-end
2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a $10,000 investment
spread equally across Cramer's picks would have lost 94%, leaving you
with a grand total of $597.44. Perhaps Cramer meant that his stocks would
be "winners" not in "the new world," but in the world to come.
Commentary on the Introduction  17

one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that
its future returns have nowhere to go but down.

   For now at least, no one has the gall to try claiming that technology
will still be the world's greatest growth industry. But make sure you
remember this: The people who now claim that the next "sure thing"
will be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely
to be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.

T H E S I LV E R L I N I N G

If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we've
reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The
pendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational
exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27
billion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-
rities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cut
back on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to
buy stocks in the late 1990s--when they were going up in price and,
therefore, becoming expensive--sold stocks as they went down in
price and, by definition, became cheaper.

   As Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly back-
wards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,
not less, as their prices rise--and less risky, not more, as their prices
fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks
more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash
on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear
market, since it puts stocks back on sale.8

   So take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news
everyone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now
is a considerably safer--and saner--time to be building wealth. Read
on, and let Graham show you how.

8 The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced stage of
retirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even an
elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone
down in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones
but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs
for tax purposes.
CHAPTER 1

Investment versus Speculation: Results to

Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor

This chapter will outline the viewpoints that will be set forth in

the remainder of the book. In particular we wish to develop at the
outset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ-
ual, nonprofessional investor.

Investment versus Speculation

   What do we mean by "investor"? Throughout this book the
term will be used in contradistinction to "speculator." As far back
as 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1 we attempted a precise
formulation of the difference between the two, as follows: "An
investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-
ises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not
meeting these requirements are speculative."

   While we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the
ensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that
have occurred in the use of the term "investor" during this period.
After the great market decline of 1929­1932 all common stocks
were widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-
ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)
Thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that
it gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.

   Now our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our
readers from accepting the common jargon which applies the term
"investor" to anybody and everybody in the stock market. In our
last edition we cited the following headline of a front-page article
of our leading financial journal in June 1962:

18
Investment versus Speculation  19

SMALL INVESTORS BEARISH, THEY ARE SELLING ODD-LOTS SHORT

In October 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it
called "reckless investors," who this time were rushing in on the
buying side.

   These quotations well illustrate the confusion that has been
dominant for many years in the use of the words investment and
speculation. Think of our suggested definition of investment given
above, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an
inexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what
he is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he
will be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-
evant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market
had already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-
ting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time
as possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used
phrase "reckless investors" could be regarded as a laughable con-
tradiction in terms--something like "spendthrift misers"--were
this misuse of language not so mischievous.

   The newspaper employed the word "investor" in these
instances because, in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone
who buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of
what he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for
cash or on margin. Compare this with the attitude of the public
toward common stocks in 1948, when over 90% of those queried
expressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common
stocks.3 About half gave as their reason "not safe, a gamble," and
about half, the reason "not familiar with."* It is indeed ironical

* The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of
Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July, 1948.
People were asked, "Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He
can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think
would be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays--put it in
the bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common
stock with it?" Only 4% thought common stock would offer a "satisfactory"
return; 26% considered it "not safe" or a "gamble." From 1949 through
1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,

(though not surprising) that common-stock purchases of all kinds
were quite generally regarded as highly speculative or risky at a
time when they were selling on a most attractive basis, and due
soon to begin their greatest advance in history; conversely the very
fact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev-
els as judged by past experience later transformed them into "invest-
ments," and the entire stock-buying public into "investors."

   The distinction between investment and speculation in common
stocks has always been a useful one and its disappearance is a
cause for concern. We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-
tion would be well advised to reinstate this distinction and to
emphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock
exchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,
which those who suffered them had not been properly warned
against. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-
rassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from
the inclusion of speculative common stocks in their own capital
funds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably
clear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-
ments--risks which are inseparable from the opportunities of
profit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the
investor's calculations.

   What we have just said indicates that there may no longer be
such a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-
sentative common stocks--in the sense that one can always wait to
buy them at a price that involves no risk of a market or "quota-
tional" loss large enough to be disquieting. In most periods the
investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his
common-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component
within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-
ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.

   Two paragraphs should be added about stock speculation per
se, as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent

averaging 18.7% annually. In a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a
poll conducted by BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of
investors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios,
down from 47% just three years earlier.
Investment versus Speculation  21

in most representative common stocks. Outright speculation is
neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the
pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and
unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-
stantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein
must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as
there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which
speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1)
speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-
ously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge
and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you
can afford to lose.

   In our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates
on margin should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating, and it
is his broker's duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a
so-called "hot" common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any
way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation
is always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead
of the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion--
the smaller the better--of your capital in a separate fund for this
purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the

* Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without speculation, untested
new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier times, the Edison Electric
Light Co.) would never be able to raise the necessary capital for expansion.
The alluring, long-shot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates
the machinery of innovation. Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never elimi-
nated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary
risk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual
risk--the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!
 A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow
from the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more
when your stocks go up--but you can be wiped out when they go down. The
collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your account--so you
must put up more money if that value falls below the amount you borrowed.

market has gone up and profits are rolling in. (That's the time to
think of taking money out of your speculative fund.) Never mingle
your speculative and investment operations in the same account,
nor in any part of your thinking.

Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor

   We have already defined the defensive investor as one inter-
ested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother. In general what
course should he follow and what return can he expect under
"average normal conditions"--if such conditions really exist? To
answer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on
the subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have
occurred since then in the underlying factors governing the
investor's expectable return, and finally what he should do and
what he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.

1. What We Said Six Years Ago

   We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between
high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion
held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the
converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;
that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50­50 proportion
between the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when
market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As
an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock
component to 25% "if he felt the market was dangerously high,"
and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% "if he
felt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly
attractive."

   In 1965 the investor could obtain about 41/2% on high-grade tax-
able bonds and 31/4% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return
on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about
3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that "at
normal levels of the market" the investor should be able to obtain
an initial dividend return of between 31/2% and 41/2% on his stock
purchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-
ing value (and in the "normal market price") of a representative
Investment versus Speculation  23

stock list of about the same amount, giving a return from divi-
dends and appreciation combined of about 71/2% per year. The half
and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%
before income tax. We added that the stock component should
carry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power
caused by large-scale inflation.

   It should be pointed out that the above arithmetic indicated
expectation of a much lower rate of advance in the stock market
than had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-
aged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it
was quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly
satisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people
were willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate
of advance in the past means that stock prices are "now too high,"
and hence that "the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not
very good but bad results for the future."4

2. What Has Happened Since 1964

   The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on
first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since
been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The
obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71/2% and
even more against 41/2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend
return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-
ket decline of 1969­70, but as we write (with "the Dow" at 900) it is
less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going
interest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the
market price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this
period.

   There is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we
discussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be
too high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not
consider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to
the price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we
know of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that "a long-term bond may vary
widely in price in response to changes in interest rates." In the light
of what has since happened we think that this warning--with
attendant examples--was insufficiently stressed. For the fact is that
24  The Intelligent Investor

if the investor had a given sum in the DJIA at its closing price of
874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971;
even at the lowest level (631) in 1970 his indicated loss would have
been less than that shown on good long-term bonds. On the other
hand, if he had confined his bond-type investments to U.S. savings
bonds, short-term corporate issues, or savings accounts, he would
have had no loss in market value of his principal during this period
and he would have enjoyed a higher income return than was
offered by good stocks. It turned out, therefore, that true "cash
equivalents" proved to be better investments in 1964 than common
stocks--in spite of the inflation experience that in theory should
have favored stocks over cash. The decline in quoted principal
value of good longer-term bonds was due to developments in the
money market, an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an
important bearing on the investment policy of individuals.

   This is just another of an endless series of experiences over time
that have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never
predictable.* Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than
stock prices, and investors generally could buy good bonds of any
maturity without having to worry about changes in their market
value. There were a few exceptions to this rule, and the period after
1964 proved to be one of them. We shall have more to say about
change in bond prices in a later chapter.

3. Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972

   Toward the end of 1971 it was possible to obtain 8% taxable
interest on good medium-term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free
on good state or municipal securities. In the shorter-term field the
investor could realize about 6% on U.S. government issues due in
five years. In the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about

* Read Graham's sentence again, and note what this greatest of investing
experts is saying: The future of security prices is never predictable. And as
you read ahead in the book, notice how everything else Graham tells you is
designed to help you grapple with that truth. Since you cannot predict the
behavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own
behavior.
Investment versus Speculation  25

a possible loss in market value, since he is sure of full repayment,
including the 6% interest return, at the end of a comparatively
short holding period. The DJIA at its recurrent price level of 900 in
1971 yields only 3.5%.

   Let us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision
to be made is how to divide the fund between high-grade bonds
(or other so-called "cash equivalents") and leading DJIA-type
stocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-
ditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant
upward or a significant downward movement for some time in the
future? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse
change, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-
rent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average
annual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this
appreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-
ous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-
tributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his
stocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-
est on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return
on stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5 This would be about the
same as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.

   These expectations are much less favorable for stocks against
bonds than they were in our 1964 analysis. (That conclusion fol-
lows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up
much more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight

* How well did Graham's forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems, very
well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned
an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period
for his forecast, but it's plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-
year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this
period, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his
chapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the "Gordon equation,"
which essentially holds that the stock market's future return is the sum of the
current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield
of just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around
2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly
6% is plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)
26  The Intelligent Investor

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds
are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-
dends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are
forced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bond
investment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If we
could be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise
the defensive investor to put all his money in bonds and none in
common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-
cantly in favor of stocks.

   But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-
ter than stocks from today's levels. The reader will immediately
think of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In
the next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experience
with inflation in the United States during this century would not
support the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials
in yield. But there is always the possibility--though we consider it
remote--of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another
would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a
fixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility--
which we also consider highly unlikely--that American business
will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-
tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.
Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness
another great speculative rise in the stock market without a real
justification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, and
perhaps others we haven't thought of, might cause the investor to
regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable
yield levels.

   Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-
ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy

* Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were
introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice
for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise
in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing the
investor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee
and, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For
more details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)
Investment versus Speculation  27

for defensive investors--namely that at all times they have a signif-
icant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant
part also in equities. It is still true that they may choose between
maintaining a simple 50­50 division between the two components
or a ratio, dependent on their judgment, varying between a mini-
mum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of either. We shall give our
more detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.

   Since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks
is nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectable
return (including growth of stock values) for the investor would
change little regardless of how he divides his fund between the
two components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from
both parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free
(or estimated tax-paid) basis. A return of this order is appreciably
higher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over
most of the long-term past. It may not seem attractive in relation to
the 14%, or so, return shown by common stocks during the 20
years of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be
remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIA had
advanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had
about doubled. Hence the greater part of the impressive market
record for that period was based on a change in investors' and
speculators' attitudes rather than in underlying corporate values.
To that extent it might well be called a "bootstrap operation."

   In discussing the common-stock portfolio of the defensive
investor, we have spoken only of leading issues of the type
included in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age. We have done this for convenience, and not to imply that these
30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him. Actually, there are
many other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average
of the Dow Jones list; these would include a host of public utilities
(which have a separate Dow Jones average to represent them).* But

* Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones Industrial
Average are the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (the "S & P") and the
Wilshire 5000 index. The S & P focuses on 500 large, well-known compa-
nies that make up roughly 70% of the total value of the U.S. equity market.
The Wilshire 5000 follows the returns of nearly every significant, publicly
28  The Intelligent Investor

the major point here is that the defensive investor's overall results
are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep-
resentative list than from another, or--more accurately--that nei-
ther he nor his advisers could predict with certainty whatever
differences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of skill-
ful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the
selection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-
ket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the
ability of defensive investors generally to get better than average
results--which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-
formance.* (Our skepticism extends to the management of large
funds by experts.)

   Let us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem
to prove the opposite. Between December 1960 and December 1970
the DJIA advanced from 616 to 839, or 36%. But in the same period
the much larger Standard & Poor's weighted index of 500 stocks
rose from 58.11 to 92.15, or 58%. Obviously the second group had
proved a better "buy" than the first. But who would have been so
rash as to predict in 1960 that what seemed like a miscellaneous
assortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper-
form the aristocratic "thirty tyrants" of the Dow? All this proves,
we insist, that only rarely can one make dependable predictions
about price changes, absolute or relative.

   We shall repeat here without apology--for the warning cannot
be given too often--that the investor cannot hope for better than
average results by buying new offerings, or "hot" issues of any
sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit. The
contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive
investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
condition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such

traded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-
nies account for most of the total value of the index, the return of the
Wilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500. Several low-
cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a
single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)

a list.) Aggressive investors may buy other types of common
stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-
lished by intelligent analysis.

   To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-
tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the
purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might
also utilize one of the "common trust funds," or "commingled
funds," operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,
if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-
ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration
of his investment program along standard lines. The third is the
device of "dollar-cost averaging," which means simply that the
practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when
the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up
with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-
ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as
"formula investing." The latter was already alluded to in our sug-
gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks
between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-
tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the
defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later
chapters.*

Results to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor

   Our enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and
expect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive
companion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be
worse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,
and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead
of profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,
become indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential
that the enterprising investor start with a clear conception as to

"Professional administration" by "a recognized investment-counsel firm" is
discussed in Chapter 10. "Dollar-cost averaging" is explained in Chapter 5.
30                The Intelligent Investor

which courses of action offer reasonable chances of success and
which do not.

   First let us consider several ways in which investors and specu-
lators generally have endeavored to obtain better than average
results. These include:

   1. Trading in the market. This usually means buying stocks
when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has
turned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those
which have been "behaving" better than the market average. A
small number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.
Here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the
established mechanism of the stock exchanges. Their object is to
benefit from a subsequent decline in the price of these issues, by
buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for. (As our
quotation from the Wall Street Journal on p. 19 indicates, even
"small investors"--perish the term!--sometimes try their unskilled
hand at short selling.)

   2. Short-term selectivity. This means buying stocks of compa-
nies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings,
or for which some other favorable development is anticipated.

   3. Long-term selectivity. Here the usual emphasis is on an
excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-
tinue in the future. In some cases also the "investor" may choose
companies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are
expected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies
belong frequently in some technological area--e.g., computers,
drugs, electronics--and they often are developing new processes
or products that are deemed to be especially promising.)

   We have already expressed a negative view about the investor's
overall chances of success in these areas of activity. The first we
have ruled out, on both theoretical and realistic grounds, from the
domain of investment. Stock trading is not an operation "which, on
thorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory
return." More will be said on stock trading in a later chapter.*

* See Chapter 8.
Investment versus Speculation  31

   In his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the
near term or the longer future, the investor faces obstacles of two
kinds--the first stemming from human fallibility and the second
from the nature of his competition. He may be wrong in his esti-
mate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price
may already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of
near-term selectivity, the current year's results of the company are
generally common property on Wall Street; next year's results, to
the extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-
ered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of
this year's superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for
next year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for
the same reason.

   In choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor's
handicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error
in the prediction--which we illustrated by our airlines example on
p. 6--is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-
ings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is
theoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making
correct predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect
ones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors
could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-
fessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term
future earnings?

   We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-
sion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average
results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently
sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.

   Are there any such policies available for the enterprising
investor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there
are broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in
practice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-
ments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-
eral market and at all times in at least some of the individual
issues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because
of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-
ther and assert that in an astonishingly large proportion of the
trading in common stocks, those engaged therein don't appear to
know--in polite terms--one part of their anatomy from another. In
this book we shall point out numerous examples of (past) dis-
32  The Intelligent Investor

crepancies between price and value. Thus it seems that any intelli-
gent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable
picnic on Wall Street, battening off other people's foolishness. So it
seems, but somehow it doesn't work out that simply. Buying a neg-
lected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves
a protracted and patience-trying experience. And selling short a
too popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not
only of one's courage and stamina but also of the depth of one's
pocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is
not impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.

   There is also a fairly wide group of "special situations," which
over many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return
of 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew
their way around in this field. They include intersecurity arbi-
trages, payouts or workouts in liquidations, protected hedges of
certain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-
sition which offers a substantially higher value for certain shares
than their price on the date of the announcement. The number of
such deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have
been a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti. But with the
multiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of
obstacles to mergers and of deals that didn't go through; quite a
few individual losses were thus realized in these once-reliable
operations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished
by too much competition.

* In "selling short" (or "shorting") a stock, you make a bet that its share
price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-
row shares from someone who owns them; then you immediately sell the
borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the
stock drops, you will be able to buy your replacement shares at a lower
price. The difference between the price at which you sold your borrowed
shares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit
(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs). How-
ever, if the stock goes up in price instead of down, your potential loss is
unlimited--making short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual
investors.
 In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts
multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to profit from any
Investment versus Speculation  33

   The lessened profitability of these special situations appears one
manifestation of a kind of self-destructive process--akin to the law
of diminishing returns--which has developed during the lifetime
of this book. In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-
tuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula--
based on earnings and current interest rates--for determining a
level to buy the DJIA below its "central" or "intrinsic" value,
and to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-
erning maxim of the Rothschilds: "Buy cheap and sell dear." * And
it had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained
and pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought
because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.
Alas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. A second illustra-
tion is provided by the famous "Dow Theory" of stock-market
movements, in a comparison of its indicated splendid results for
1897­1933 and its much more questionable performance since
1934.

   A third and final example of the golden opportunities not
recently available: A good part of our own operations on Wall
Street had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issues eas-
ily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than
their share in the net current assets (working capital) alone, not
counting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all
liabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling
at a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-
ness. No proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what
he owned at so ridiculously low a figure. Strangely enough, such

errors in pricing these complex deals. They became so good at it that the
easy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down.
Although Graham does discuss it again (see pp. 174­175), this sort of trad-
ing is no longer feasible or appropriate for most people, since only multi-
million-dollar trades are large enough to generate worthwhile profits.
Wealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge
funds that specialize in merger or "event" arbitrage.

anomalies were not hard to find. In 1957 a list was published show-
ing nearly 200 issues of this type available in the market. In various
ways practically all these bargain issues turned out to be profitable,
and the average annual result proved much more remunerative
than most other investments. But they too virtually disappeared
from the stock market in the next decade, and with them a depend-
able area for shrewd and successful operation by the enterprising
investor. However, at the low prices of 1970 there again appeared a
considerable number of such "sub-working-capital" issues, and
despite the strong recovery of the market, enough of them
remained at the end of the year to make up a full-sized portfolio.

   The enterprising investor under today's conditions still has vari-
ous possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge
list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be
identified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable
standards. These should yield more satisfactory results on the
average than will the DJIA or any similarly representative list. In
our view the search for these would not be worth the investor's
effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the aver-
age annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio. We shall
try to develop one or more such approaches to stock selection for
use by the active investor.
COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 1

   All of human unhappiness comes from one single thing: not
   knowing how to remain at rest in a room.

                                                                  --Blaise Pascal

Why do you suppose the brokers on the floor of the New York Stock

Exchange always cheer at the sound of the closing bell--no matter
what the market did that day? Because whenever you trade, they
make money--whether you did or not. By speculating instead of invest-
ing, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone
else's.

   Graham's definition of investing could not be clearer: "An invest-
ment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety
of principal and an adequate return." 1 Note that investing, according to
Graham, consists equally of three elements:

· you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its
     underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;

· you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;
· you must aspire to "adequate," not extraordinary, performance.

1 Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his defini-
tion: "thorough analysis" means "the study of the facts in the light of estab-
lished standards of safety and value" while "safety of principal" signifies
"protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or
variations" and "adequate" (or "satisfactory") return refers to "any rate or
amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, pro-
vided he acts with reasonable intelligence." (Security Analysis, 1934 ed.,
pp. 55­56).

                                                                                             35
36  Commentary on Chapter 1

   An investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of
its businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price
because somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once
put it, investors judge "the market price by established standards of
value," while speculators "base [their] standards of value upon the
market price." 2 For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes
is like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham
called "quotational" values matter much less. Graham urges you to
invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had
no way of knowing its daily share price.3

   Like casino gambling or betting on the horses, speculating in the
market can be exciting or even rewarding (if you happen to get lucky).
But it's the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That's because
Wall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds
so that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who
tries to beat the house at its own speculative game.

   On the other hand, investing is a unique kind of casino--one where
you cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that
put the odds squarely in your favor. People who invest make money for
themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers. And
that, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable
virtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.

U N SAFE AT H I G H S PE E D

Confusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a
mistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction. Almost
everyone, it seems, ran out of patience at once, and America became
the Speculation Nation, populated with traders who went shooting
from stock to stock like grasshoppers whizzing around in an August
hay field.

   People began believing that the test of an investment technique
was simply whether it "worked." If they beat the market over any

2 Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 310.
3 As Graham advised in an interview, "Ask yourself: If there was no market
for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on
these terms?" (Forbes, January 1, 1972, p. 90.)
Commentary on Chapter 1  37

period, no matter how dangerous or dumb their tactics, people
boasted that they were "right." But the intelligent investor has no inter-
est in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals,
you must be sustainably and reliably right. The techniques that
became so trendy in the 1990s--day trading, ignoring diversification,
flipping hot mutual funds, following stock-picking "systems"--seemed
to work. But they had no chance of prevailing in the long run, because
they failed to meet all three of Graham's criteria for investing.

   To see why temporarily high returns don't prove anything, imagine
that two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed
limit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I
can get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I "right"? Should
you be tempted to try it, too, because you hear me bragging that it
"worked"? Flashy gimmicks for beating the market are much the
same: In short streaks, so long as your luck holds out, they work. Over
time, they will get you killed.

   In 1973, when Graham last revised The Intelligent Investor, the
annual turnover rate on the New York Stock Exchange was 20%,
meaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before
selling it. By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%--a holding period of
only 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a
stock for nearly three years; by 2002, that ownership period had
shrunk to just 10.9 months. It's as if mutual-fund managers were
studying their stocks just long enough to learn they shouldn't have
bought them in the first place, then promptly dumping them and start-
ing all over.

   Even the most respected money-management firms got antsy. In
early 1995, Jeffrey Vinik, manager of Fidelity Magellan (then the
world's largest mutual fund), had 42.5% of its assets in technology
stocks. Vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders "have invested
in the fund for goals that are years away. . . . I think their objectives are
the same as mine, and that they believe, as I do, that a long-term
approach is best." But six months after he wrote those high-minded
words, Vinik sold off almost all his technology shares, unloading nearly
$19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks. So much for the "long term"!
And by 1999, Fidelity's discount brokerage division was egging on its
clients to trade anywhere, anytime, using a Palm handheld computer--
which was perfectly in tune with the firm's new slogan, "Every second
counts."

                                       customers could barely hold on to a stock for a hundred hours.

Morgan Stanley, ran a TV commercial in which a scruffy tow-truck
driver picks up a prosperous-looking executive. Spotting a photo of a
tropical beachfront posted on the dashboard, the executive asks,
"Vacation?" "Actually," replies the driver, "that's my home." Taken
aback, the suit says, "Looks like an island." With quiet triumph, the
driver answers, "Technically, it's a country."

   The propaganda went further. Online trading would take no work
and require no thought. A television ad from Ameritrade, the online
broker, showed two housewives just back from jogging; one logs on
to her computer, clicks the mouse a few times, and exults, "I think I just
made about $1,700!" In a TV commercial for the Waterhouse broker-
age firm, someone asked basketball coach Phil Jackson, "You know
anything about the trade?" His answer: "I'm going to make it right
now." (How many games would Jackson's NBA teams have won if he
had brought that philosophy to courtside? Somehow, knowing noth-
ing about the other team, but saying, "I'm ready to play them right
now," doesn't sound like a championship formula.)

   By 1999 at least six million people were trading online--and roughly
a tenth of them were "day trading," using the Internet to buy and sell
stocks at lightning speed. Everyone from showbiz diva Barbra
Streisand to Nicholas Birbas, a 25-year-old former waiter in Queens,
New York, was flinging stocks around like live coals. "Before," scoffed
Birbas, "I was investing for the long term and I found out that it was not
smart." Now, Birbas traded stocks up to 10 times a day and expected
to earn $100,000 in a year. "I can't stand to see red in my profit-or-loss
column," Streisand shuddered in an interview with Fortune. "I'm Taurus
the bull, so I react to red. If I see red, I sell my stocks quickly." 5

   By pouring continuous data about stocks into bars and barber-
shops, kitchens and cafés, taxicabs and truck stops, financial web-
sites and financial TV turned the stock market into a nonstop national
video game. The public felt more knowledgeable about the markets
than ever before. Unfortunately, while people were drowning in data,
knowledge was nowhere to be found. Stocks became entirely decou-

pled from the companies that had issued them--pure abstractions, just
blips moving across a TV or computer screen. If the blips were moving
up, nothing else mattered.

   On December 20, 1999, Juno Online Services unveiled a trailblaz-
ing business plan: to lose as much money as possible, on purpose.
Juno announced that it would henceforth offer all its retail services for
free--no charge for e-mail, no charge for Internet access--and that it
would spend millions of dollars more on advertising over the next year.
On this declaration of corporate hara-kiri, Juno's stock roared up from
$16.375 to $66.75 in two days.6

   Why bother learning whether a business was profitable, or what
goods or services a company produced, or who its management was,
or even what the company's name was? All you needed to know
about stocks was the catchy code of their ticker symbols: CBLT, INKT,
PCLN, TGLO, VRSN, WBVN.7 That way you could buy them even
faster, without the pesky two-second delay of looking them up on an
Internet search engine. In late 1998, the stock of a tiny, rarely traded
building-maintenance company, Temco Services, nearly tripled in a
matter of minutes on record-high volume. Why? In a bizarre form of
financial dyslexia, thousands of traders bought Temco after mistaking
its ticker symbol, TMCO, for that of Ticketmaster Online (TMCS), an
Internet darling whose stock began trading publicly for the first time
that day.8

   Oscar Wilde joked that a cynic "knows the price of everything, and
the value of nothing." Under that definition, the stock market is always
cynical, but by the late 1990s it would have shocked Oscar himself. A
single half-baked opinion on price could double a company's stock
even as its value went entirely unexamined. In late 1998, Henry Blod-
get, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, warned that "as with all Inter-
net stocks, a valuation is clearly more art than science." Then, citing
only the possibility of future growth, he jacked up his "price target" on

company's name used as shorthand to identify a stock for trading purposes.
8 This was not an isolated incident; on at least three other occasions in the
late 1990s, day traders sent the wrong stock soaring when they mistook its
ticker symbol for that of a newly minted Internet company.

Amazon.com from $150 to $400 in one fell swoop. Amazon.com shot
up 19% that day and--despite Blodget's protest that his price target
was a one-year forecast--soared past $400 in just three weeks. A year
later, PaineWebber analyst Walter Piecyk predicted that Qualcomm
stock would hit $1,000 a share over the next 12 months. The stock--
already up 1,842% that year--soared another 31% that day, hitting
$659 a share.9

FROM FORMULA TO FIASCO

But trading as if your underpants are on fire is not the only form of
speculation. Throughout the past decade or so, one speculative for-
mula after another was promoted, popularized, and then thrown aside.
All of them shared a few traits--This is quick! This is easy! And it won't
hurt a bit!--and all of them violated at least one of Graham's distinc-
tions between investing and speculating. Here are a few of the trendy
formulas that fell flat:

· Cash in on the calendar. The "January effect"--the tendency of
     small stocks to produce big gains around the turn of the year--
     was widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub-
     lished in the 1980s. These studies showed that if you piled into
     small stocks in the second half of December and held them into
     January, you would beat the market by five to 10 percentage
     points. That amazed many experts. After all, if it were this easy,
     surely everyone would hear about it, lots of people would do it,
     and the opportunity would wither away.
         What caused the January jolt? First of all, many investors sell
     their crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can
     cut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow
     more cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve
     their outperformance (or minimize their underperformance). That
     makes them reluctant to buy (or even hang on to) a falling stock.
     And if an underperforming stock is also small and obscure, a
     money manager will be even less eager to show it in his year-end

9 In 2000 and 2001, Amazon.com and Qualcomm lost a cumulative total of
85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.
42  Commentary on Chapter 1

     list of holdings. All these factors turn small stocks into momentary
     bargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-
     cally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.

         The January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.
     According to finance professor William Schwert of the University of
     Rochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and
     sold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5
     percentage points from 1962 through 1979, by 4.4 points from
     1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.10

         As more people learned about the January effect, more traders
     bought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain
     and thus reducing their returns. Also, the January effect is biggest
     among the smallest stocks--but according to Plexus Group, the
     leading authority on brokerage expenses, the total cost of buying
     and selling such tiny stocks can run up to 8% of your invest-
     ment.11 Sadly, by the time you're done paying your broker, all your
     gains on the January effect will melt away.
· Just do "what works." In 1996, an obscure money manager
     named James O'Shaughnessy published a book called What
     Works on Wall Street. In it, he argued that "investors can do
     much better than the market." O'Shaughnessy made a stunning
     claim: From 1954 through 1994, you could have turned $10,000
     into $8,074,504, beating the market by more than 10-fold--a tow-
     ering 18.2% average annual return. How? By buying a basket of
     50 stocks with the highest one-year returns, five straight years of
     rising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5 times their corpo-
     rate revenues.12 As if he were the Edison of Wall Street,
     O'Shaughnessy obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,978,778 for his "auto-
     mated strategies" and launched a group of four mutual funds
     based on his findings. By late 1999 the funds had sucked in more
     than $175 million from the public--and, in his annual letter to
     shareholders, O'Shaughnessy stated grandly: "As always, I hope

                                            course and sticking with our time-tested investment strategies."

                                               But "what works on Wall Street" stopped working right after
                                            O'Shaughnessy publicized it. As Figure 1-2 shows, two of his
                                            funds stank so badly that they shut down in early 2000, and the

     overall stock market (as measured by the S & P 500 index) wal-
     loped every O'Shaughnessy fund almost nonstop for nearly four
     years running.

         In June 2000, O'Shaughnessy moved closer to his own "long-

     his customers to fend for themselves with those "time-tested

· Follow "The Foolish Four." In the mid-1990s, the Motley Fool
     website (and several books) hyped the daylights out of a tech-
     nique called "The Foolish Four." According to the Motley Fool, you
     would have "trashed the market averages over the last 25 years"
     and could "crush your mutual funds" by spending "only 15 min-
     utes a year" on planning your investments. Best of all, this tech-
     nique had "minimal risk." All you needed to do was this:

       1. Take the five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average with
           the lowest stock prices and highest dividend yields.

       2. Discard the one with the lowest price.
       3. Put 40% of your money in the stock with the second-lowest

           price.
       4. Put 20% in each of the three remaining stocks.
       5. One year later, sort the Dow the same way and reset the

           portfolio according to steps 1 through 4.
       6. Repeat until wealthy.

         Over a 25-year period, the Motley Fool claimed, this technique
     would have beaten the market by a remarkable 10.1 percentage

13 In a remarkable irony, the surviving two O'Shaughnessy funds (now
known as the Hennessy funds) began performing quite well just as
O'Shaughnessy announced that he was turning over the management to
another company. The funds' shareholders were furious. In a chat room at
www.morningstar.com, one fumed: "I guess `long term' for O'S is 3 years.
. . . I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O'S's method. . . . I had told several
friends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they didn't act on my

points annually. Over the next two decades, they suggested,
$20,000 invested in The Foolish Four should flower into
$1,791,000. (And, they claimed, you could do still better by pick-
ing the five Dow stocks with the highest ratio of dividend yield to
the square root of stock price, dropping the one that scored the
highest, and buying the next four.)

   Let's consider whether this "strategy" could meet Graham's
definitions of an investment:

· What kind of "thorough analysis" could justify discarding the
  stock with the single most attractive price and dividend--but
  keeping the four that score lower for those desirable qualities?

· How could putting 40% of your money into only one stock be a
  "minimal risk"?

· And how could a portfolio of only four stocks be diversified
  enough to provide "safety of principal"?

   The Foolish Four, in short, was one of the most cockamamie
stock-picking formulas ever concocted. The Fools made the same
mistake as O'Shaughnessy: If you look at a large quantity of data
long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge--if only by
chance. By random luck alone, the companies that produce
above-average stock returns will have plenty of things in common.
But unless those factors cause the stocks to outperform, they
can't be used to predict future returns.

   None of the factors that the Motley Fools "discovered" with
such fanfare--dropping the stock with the best score, doubling up
on the one with the second-highest score, dividing the dividend
yield by the square root of stock price--could possibly cause or
explain the future performance of a stock. Money Magazine found
that a portfolio made up of stocks whose names contained no
repeating letters would have performed nearly as well as The
Foolish Four--and for the same reason: luck alone.14 As Graham
never stops reminding us, stocks do well or poorly in the future
because the businesses behind them do well or poorly--nothing
more, and nothing less.

46  Commentary on Chapter 1

       Sure enough, instead of crushing the market, The Foolish Four
    crushed the thousands of people who were fooled into believing
    that it was a form of investing. In 2000 alone, the four Foolish
    stocks--Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, SBC, and General Motors--
    lost 14% while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%.

   As these examples show, there's only one thing that never suffers a
bear market on Wall Street: dopey ideas. Each of these so-called
investing approaches fell prey to Graham's Law. All mechanical formu-
las for earning higher stock performance are "a kind of self-destructive
process--akin to the law of diminishing returns." There are two reasons
the returns fade away. If the formula was just based on random statis-
tical flukes (like The Foolish Four), the mere passage of time will
expose that it made no sense in the first place. On the other hand, if
the formula actually did work in the past (like the January effect), then
by publicizing it, market pundits always erode--and usually eliminate--
its ability to do so in the future.

   All this reinforces Graham's warning that you must treat specula-
tion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:

· You must never delude yourself into thinking that you're investing
     when you're speculating.

· Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin
     to take it seriously.

· You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.

   Just as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor
and leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room,
the intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as
a "mad money" account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is
the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Never min-
gle the money in your speculative account with what's in your invest-
ment accounts; never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into
your investing activities; and never put more than 10% of your assets
into your mad money account, no matter what happens.

   For better or worse, the gambling instinct is part of human nature--
so it's futile for most people even to try suppressing it. But you must
confine and restrain it. That's the single best way to make sure you will
never fool yourself into confusing speculation with investment.
CHAPTER 2

The Investor and Inflation

Inflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the

public's mind in recent years. The shrinkage in the purchasing
power of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope
by speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has
greatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those
with a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living
advances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-
pal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a
loss of the dollar's purchasing power may be offset by advances in
their dividends and the prices of their shares.

   On the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities
have concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form
of investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by their
very nature more desirable investments than bonds. We have
heard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios
should consist 100% of stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is
quite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were

* By the late 1990s, this advice--which can be appropriate for a foundation
or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon--had spread to indi-
vidual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994 edition of his influ-
ential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the
Wharton School recommended that "risk-taking" investors should buy on
margin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their
assets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February
1999, the Honorable Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the
audience at an investment conference: "It doesn't make any sense for any-
one to have any money in a bond fund."

                                                                                             47

restricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice preferred
stocks).

   Our readers must have enough intelligence to recognize that
even high-quality stocks cannot be a better purchase than bonds
under all conditions--i.e., regardless of how high the stock market
may be and how low the current dividend return compared with
the rates available on bonds. A statement of this kind would be as
absurd as was the contrary one--too often heard years ago--that
any bond is safer than any stock. In this chapter we shall try to
apply various measurements to the inflation factor, in order to
reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may
wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the
price level.

   In this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our
views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-
tion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it
has taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-
tions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them
in confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a
condensed historical tabulation that contains much information
about changes in the general price level and concomitant changes
in the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures
will begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-
year intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of
wartime price controls.)

   The first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the
past--lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and
1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with
the advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have
had three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at
varying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor
should clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent
inflation to come.

   Can we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear
answer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It
would seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-
sistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the
consumer price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for
1965­1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%. Official govern-

ment policy has been strongly against large-scale inflation, and
there are some reasons to believe that Federal policies will be more
effective in the future than in recent years.* We think it would be
reasonable for an investor at this point to base his thinking and
decisions on a probable (far from certain) rate of future inflation of,
say, 3% per annum. (This would compare with an annual rate of
about 21/2% for the entire period 1915­1970.)1

   What would be the implications of such an advance? It would
eat up, in higher living costs, about one-half the income now
obtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed
after-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would
be a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would
not mean that the true value, or the purchasing power, of the
investor's fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half
his interest income after taxes he would maintain this buying
power intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.

   But the next question, naturally, is, "Can the investor be reason-
ably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than
high-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered
in 1970­1971?" Would not, for example, an all-stock program be
preferable to a part-bond, part-stock program? Do not common
stocks have a built-in protection against inflation, and are they not
almost certain to give a better return over the years than will
bonds? Have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than
have bonds over the 55-year period of our study?

   The answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Com-
mon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period
of time in the past. The rise of the DJIA from an average of 77 in
1915 to an average of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual com-
pounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%
for average dividend return. (The corresponding figures for the
S & P composite are about the same.) These combined figures of 8%

* This is one of Graham's rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two years after
President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls, inflation hit
8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The decade from 1973
through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern American history, as the
cost of living more than doubled.
The Investor and Inflation  51

per year are of course much better than the return enjoyed from
bonds over the same 55-year period. But they do not exceed that
now offered by high-grade bonds. This brings us to the next logical
question: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common
stocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in
the last five and one-half decades?

   Our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common
stocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far
from certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time
elements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to
occur over the long-term future--say, the next 25 years. The second
applies to what is likely to happen to the investor--both financially
and psychologically--over short or intermediate periods, say five
years or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his
satisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-
sions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of
a lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year
to year.

   On this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-
nection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the
movement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious
example is the recent period, 1966­1970. The rise in the cost of liv-
ing was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946­1950. But
both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since
1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the
record of previous five-year periods.

Inflation and Corporate Earnings

   Another and highly important approach to the subject is by a
study of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.
This has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic
activity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with
wholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen
rather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of
the period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of
more liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-
ies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on
much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group--
52            The Intelligent Investor

about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares.2
Since the market value of these issues is well above their book
value--say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971--the earnings on
current market price work out only at some 61/4%. (This relation-
ship is generally expressed in the reverse, or "times earnings,"
manner--e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual
earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)

   Our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous
chapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return
of about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-
tion of, say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note
that each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase
the market price by about $1.60.)

   The reader will object that in the end our calculations make no
allowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to
result from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is
the absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount
in the past has had any direct effect on reported per-share earnings.
The cold figures demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings
of the DJIA unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately
large growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If
inflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect
would have been to increase the "value" of previously existing
capital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old
capital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. But
nothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during
which the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40%. (Busi-
ness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than
by "consumer prices.") The only way that inflation can add to
common stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on cap-
ital investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been
the case.

   In the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-
nied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It
was generally felt that "a little inflation" was helpful to business
profits. This view is not contradicted by the history of 1950­1970,

* See p. 25.
              The Investor and Inflation                53

which reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and
generally rising prices. But the figures indicate that the effect of all
this on the earning power of common-stock capital ("equity capital")
has been quite limited; in fact it has not even served to maintain the
rate of earnings on the investment. Clearly there have been impor-
tant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the
real profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the
most important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceed-
ing the gains in productivity, and (2) the need for huge amounts
of new capital, thus holding down the ratio of sales to capital
employed.

   Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has
been quite the opposite. The most striking figures in our table are
those for the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969. It is
surprising how little attention has been paid by economists and by
Wall Street to this development. The debt of corporations has
expanded nearly fivefold while their profits before taxes a little
more than doubled. With the great rise in interest rates during this
period, it is evident that the aggregate corporate debt is now an

adverse economic factor of some magnitude and a real problem for
many individual enterprises. (Note that in 1950 net earnings after
interest but before income tax were about 30% of corporate debt,
while in 1969 they were only 13.2% of debt. The 1970 ratio must
have been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a signifi-
cant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a whole
is accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing
4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the
debt ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have
fallen still lower, in spite of the inflation.

   The stock market has considered that the public-utility enter-
prises have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a
great advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of
raising the rates charged under the regulatory process. But this
may be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of
electricity, gas, and telephone services have advanced so much less
than the general price index puts these companies in a strong
strategic position for the future.3 They are entitled by law to charge
rates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital, and
this will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has
in the inflations of the past.

   All of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the
investor has no sound basis for expecting more than an average
overall return of, say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common
stocks purchased at the late 1971 price level. But even if these
expectations should prove to be understated by a substantial
amount, the case would not be made for an all-stock investment
program. If there is one thing guaranteed for the future, it is that
the earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio
will not grow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other figure. In the
memorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, "They will fluctuate." *
This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today's prices--

* John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence, he was
constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan developed a
mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: "It will fluctuate." See Jean
Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (Random House, 1999), p. 11.

or tomorrow's--will be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory
results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25 years for Gen-
eral Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground lost in the
1929­1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor concentrates his
portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either
by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This is particu-
larly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur-
ther inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he will
take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as a
chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a vindica-
tion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying
common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low
the dividend return. That way lies sorrow.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

   The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust
their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against
the law for American citizens since 1935--luckily for them. In the
past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced
from $35 per ounce to $48 in early 1972--a rise of only 35%. But
during all this time the holder of gold has received no income
return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual
expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done much better
with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in
the general price level.

   The near-complete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the
purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the abil-
ity of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by
putting his money in "things."* Quite a few categories of valuable

* The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham was
"dead wrong" about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at least in the
years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust ability to out-
pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein agrees, pointing out that a
tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund (say, 2% of your total assets) is too
small to hurt your overall returns when gold does poorly. But, when gold
does well, its returns are often so spectacular--sometimes exceeding 100%
56  The Intelligent Investor

objects have had striking advances in market value over the
years--such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of
books, rare stamps and coins, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of
these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the pre-
carious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is
hard to think of paying $67,500 for a U.S. silver dollar dated 1804
(but not even minted that year) as an "investment operation."4 We
acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our
readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

   The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered
as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount
of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are
also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in
location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen's wiles.
Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate
means, except by various types of participations with others and
with the special hazards that attach to new flotations--not too dif-
ferent from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All
we should say to the investor is, "Be sure it's yours before you go
into it."

Conclusion

   Naturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous
chapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor
cannot afford to put all his funds into one basket--neither in the
bond basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds
have recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect
of continuing inflation.

   The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income
therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the

in a year--that it can, all by itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter-
ing. However, the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its
high storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging

unexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life. It is
axiomatic that the conservative investor should seek to minimize
his risks. We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a
telephone-company bond at yields of nearly 71/2% are much less
than those involved in buying the DJIA at 900 (or any stock list
equivalent thereto). But the possibility of large-scale inflation
remains, and the investor must carry some insurance against it.
There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately
against such inflation, but it should carry more protection than the
bond component.

   This is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition (p. 97),
and we would write the same today:

    It must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common stocks at these levels (892 for the DJIA). For reasons
already given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to
be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his
portfolio, even if we regard them as the lesser of two evils--the
greater being the risks in an all-bond holding.

Inflation? Who cares about that ?

   After all, the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged
less than 2.2% between 1997 and 2002--and economists believe
that even that rock-bottom rate may be overstated.1 (Think, for
instance, of how the prices of computers and home electronics have
plummeted--and how the quality of many goods has risen, meaning
that consumers are getting better value for their money.) In recent
years, the true rate of inflation in the United States has probably run
around 1% annually--an increase so infinitesimal that many pundits
have proclaimed that "inflation is dead." 2

1 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the Consumer Price
Index that measures inflation, maintains a comprehensive and helpful web-
site at www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.
2 For a lively discussion of the "inflation is dead" scenario, see www.pbs.
org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html. In 1996, the
Boskin Commission, a group of economists asked by the government to
investigate whether the official rate of inflation is accurate, estimated that it
has been overstated, often by nearly two percentage points per year. For the
commission's report, see www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html. Many
investment experts now feel that deflation, or falling prices, is an even
greater threat than inflation; the best way to hedge against that risk is by
including bonds as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the com-
mentary on Chapter 4.)

THE MONEY ILLUSION

There's another reason investors overlook the importance of inflation:
what psychologists call the "money illusion." If you receive a 2% raise
in a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost certainly feel better
than you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a year when inflation is
zero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical
position--2% worse off after inflation. So long as the nominal (or
absolute) change is positive, we view it as a good thing--even if the
real (or after-inflation) result is negative. And any change in your own
salary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices
in the economy as a whole.3 Likewise, investors were delighted to earn
11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly
disappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003--even though
they were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up
with inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank's
ads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel
good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of
taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That's why inflation
is so easy to overlook--and why it's so important to measure your
investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you
keep after inflation.

   More basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard
against whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three
good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:

· As recently as 1973­1982, the United States went through one
     of the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured
     by the Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over
     that period, rising at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979
     alone, inflation raged at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what
     became known as "stagflation"--and leading many commentators
     to question whether America could compete in the global market-

3 For more insights into this behavioral pitfall, see Eldar Shafir, Peter Dia-
mond, and Amos Tversky, "Money Illusion," in Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky, eds., Choices, Values, and Frames (Cambridge University Press,

     place.4 Goods and services priced at $100 in the beginning of
     1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dol-
     lar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff
     at such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to
     protect against the risk that it might recur.
· Since 1960, 69% of the world's market-oriented countries have
     suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized
     rate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods
     destroyed 53% of an investor's purchasing power.5 We would be
     crazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a
     disaster. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it can
     never happen here.6
· Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars
     that have been cheapened by inflation. Completely eradicating
     inflation runs against the economic self-interest of any govern-
     ment that regularly borrows money.7

4 That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous "malaise" speech, in
which he warned of "a crisis in confidence" that "strikes at the very heart
and soul and spirit of our national will" and "threatens to destroy the social
and the political fabric of America."
5 See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, "Modern Hyper-
and High Inflations," National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper
8930, at www.nber.org/papers/w8930.
6 In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the
American Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through
1779, with a pound of butter costing $12 and a barrel of flour fetching
nearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-
tion raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and nearly 200% (in the
Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.
7 I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,
but accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or steadily falling
prices) it's more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower--which is why
most investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds,
as a form of insurance against deflating prices.
Commentary on Chapter 2  61

HALF A HEDGE

What, then, can the intelligent investor do to guard against inflation?
The standard answer is "buy stocks"--but, as common answers so
often are, it is not entirely true.

   Figure 2-1 shows, for each year from 1926 through 2002, the rela-
tionship between inflation and stock prices.

   As you can see, in years when the prices of consumer goods and
services fell, as on the left side of the graph, stock returns were terri-
ble--with the market losing up to 43% of its value.8 When inflation shot
above 6%, as in the years on the right end of the graph, stocks also
stank. The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which
inflation exceeded 6%; the average return for those 14 years was a
measly 2.6%.

   While mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs
of their own raw materials on to customers, high inflation wreaks
havoc--forcing customers to slash their purchases and depressing
activity throughout the economy.

   The historical evidence is clear: Since the advent of accurate
stock-market data in 1926, there have been 64 five-year periods
(i.e., 1926­1930, 1927­1931, 1928­1932, and so on through
1998­2002). In 50 of those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time),
stocks outpaced inflation.9 That's impressive, but imperfect; it means
that stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.

8 When inflation is negative, it is technically termed "deflation." Regularly
falling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think of the Japanese
example. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989, with real estate
and the stock market dropping in value year after year--a relentless water
torture for the world's second-largest economy.

dent outside the United States: In Belgium, Italy, and Germany, where infla-
tion was especially high in the twentieth century, "inflation appears to have
had a negative impact on both stock and bond markets," note Elroy Dimson,
Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton in Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of
Global Investment Returns (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 53.

TWO ACRONYMS TO THE RESCUE

Fortunately, you can bolster your defenses against inflation by branch-
ing out beyond stocks. Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters
have become widely available to investors:

   REITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced
"reets"), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial
and residential properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds,
REITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van-
guard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include
Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund,
and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is
unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give
you some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without
hampering your overall returns.

   TIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S.
government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in
value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the
United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from
the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran-
tee that the value of your investment won't be eroded by inflation. In
one easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the
loss of purchasing power.12

   There is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond
rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that
increase in value as taxable income--even though it is purely a paper

10 Thorough, if sometimes outdated, information on REITs can be found at
www.nareit.com.
11 For further information, see www.vanguard.com, www.cohenandsteers.
com, www.columbiafunds.com, and www.fidelity.com. The case for investing
in a REIT fund is weaker if you own a home, since that gives you an inherent
stake in real-estate ownership.

gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does
this make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the
wise words of financial analyst Mark Schweber: "The one question
never to ask a bureaucrat is `Why?' " Because of this exasperating tax
complication, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement
account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your
taxable income.

   You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at www.
publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like
Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected
Bond Fund.13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal sub-
stitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise
keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run,
so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors,
allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelli-
gent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe--and entirely
beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

CHAPTER 3

A Century of Stock-Market History:

The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972

The investor's portfolio of common stocks will represent a small

cross-section of that immense and formidable institution known as
the stock market. Prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea
of stock-market history, in terms particularly of the major fluctua-
tions in its price level and of the varying relationships between
stock prices as a whole and their earnings and dividends. With this
background he may be in a position to form some worthwhile
judgment of the attractiveness or dangers of the level of the market
as it presents itself at different times. By a coincidence, useful sta-
tistical data on prices, earnings, and dividends go back just 100
years, to 1871. (The material is not nearly as full or dependable in
the first half-period as in the second, but it will serve.) In this chap-
ter we shall present the figures, in highly condensed form, with
two objects in view. The first is to show the general manner in
which stocks have made their underlying advance through the
many cycles of the past century. The second is to view the picture
in terms of successive ten-year averages, not only of stock prices
but of earnings and dividends as well, to bring out the varying
relationship between the three important factors. With this wealth
of material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the
level of stock prices at the beginning of 1972.

   The long-term history of the stock market is summarized in two
tables and a chart. Table 3-1 sets forth the low and high points of
nineteen bear- and bull-market cycles in the past 100 years. We
have used two indexes here. The first represents a combination of
an early study by the Cowles Commission going back to 1870,
which has been spliced on to and continued to date in the well-

known Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks. The sec-
ond is the even more celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (the
DJIA, or "the Dow"), which dates back to 1897; it contains 30 com-
panies, of which one is American Telephone & Telegraph and the
other 29 are large industrial enterprises.1

   Chart I, presented by courtesy of Standard & Poor's, depicts the
market fluctuations of its 425-industrial-stock index from 1900
through 1970. (A corresponding chart available for the DJIA will
look very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct
patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs
from 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather
similar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual
advance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the
"New Era" bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible after-
math of collapse, followed by quite irregular fluctuations until
1949. Comparing the average level of 1949 with that of 1924, we
find the annual rate of advance to be a mere 11/2%; hence the close of
our second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for
common stocks. By the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the
beginning of the greatest bull market in our history, presented in
the last third of our chart. This phenomenon may have reached its
culmination in December 1968 at 118 for Standard & Poor's 425
industrials (and 108 for its 500-stock composite). As Table 3-1
shows, there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968
(especially in 1956­57 and 1961­62), but the recoveries therefrom
were so rapid that they had to be denominated (in the long-
accepted semantics) as recessions in a single bull market, rather
than as separate market cycles. Between the low level of 162 for
"the Dow" in mid-1949 and the high of 995 in early 1966, the
advance had been more than sixfold in 17 years--which is at the
average compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends
of, say, 31/2% per annum. (The advance for the Standard & Poor's
composite index was somewhat greater than that of the DJIA--
actually from 14 to 96.)

   These 14% and better returns were documented in 1963, and
later, in a much publicized study.*2 It created a natural satisfaction

on Wall Street with such fine achievements, and a quite illogical and
dangerous conviction that equally marvelous results could be
expected for common stocks in the future. Few people seem to have
been bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might
indicate that it had been overdone. The subsequent decline from the
1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the Standard & Poor's com-
posite (and 37% for the DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in
1939­1942, which had reflected the perils and uncertainties after
Pearl Harbor. In the dramatic manner so characteristic of Wall
Street, the low level of May 1970 was followed by a massive and
speedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of a new
all-time high for the Standard & Poor's industrials in early 1972.
The annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out
at about 9% for the S & P composite (or the industrial index), using
the average figures for both years. That rate of climb was, of course,
much greater than for any similar period before 1950. (But in the last
decade the rate of advance was much lower--51/4% for the S & P
composite index and only the once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)

   The record of price movements should be supplemented by cor-
responding figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide
an overall view of what has happened to our share economy over
the ten decades. We present a conspectus of this kind in our Table
3-2 (p. 71). It is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study
all these figures with care, but for some we hope they will be inter-
esting and instructive.

   Let us comment on them as follows: The full decade figures
smooth out the year-to-year fluctuations and leave a general pic-
ture of persistent growth. Only two of the nine decades after the
first show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 1891­1900
and 1931­1940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver-
age dividends. But the rates of growth in all three categories are
quite variable. In general the performance since World War II has
been superior to that of earlier decades, but the advance in the
1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s. Today's investor

cannot tell from this record what percentage gain in earnings divi-
dends and prices he may expect in the next ten years, but it does
supply all the encouragement he needs for a consistent policy of
common-stock investment.

   However, a point should be made here that is not disclosed in
our table. The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in
the overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit
on invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World
War years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number
of companies reported net losses for the year; many became "finan-
cially troubled," and for the first time in three decades there were
quite a few important bankruptcy proceedings. These facts as
much as any others have prompted the statement made above*
that the great boom era may have come to an end in 1969­1970.

   A striking feature of Table 3-2 is the change in the price/earn-
ings ratios since World War II. In June 1949 the S & P composite
index sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12
months; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi-
dend yield on the S & P index had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to
only 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest
rates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to
4.50%. This is certainly the most remarkable turnabout in the
public's attitude in all stock-market history.

   To people of long experience and innate caution the passage
from one extreme to another carried a strong warning of trou-
ble ahead. They could not help thinking apprehensively of the
1926­1929 bull market and its tragic aftermath. But these fears have
not been confirmed by the event. True, the closing price of the DJIA

* See pp. 50­52.
 The "price/earnings ratio" of a stock, or of a market average like the S & P
500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the market's temperature. If, for
instance, a company earned $1 per share of net income over the past year,
and its stock is selling at $8.93 per share, its price/earnings ratio would be
8.93; if, however, the stock is selling at $69.70, then the price/earnings ratio
would be 69.7. In general, a price/earnings ratio (or "P/E" ratio) below 10 is
considered low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater
than 20 is considered expensive. (For more on P/E ratios, see p. 168.)

in 1970 was the same as it was 61/2 years earlier, and the much her-
alded "Soaring Sixties" proved to be mainly a march up a series of
high hills and then down again. But nothing has happened either
to business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar-
ket and depression of 1929­1932.

The Stock-Market Level in Early 1972

   With a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and
dividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions
about the level of 900 for the DJIA and 100 for the S & P composite
index in January 1972.

   In each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the
stock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the
question whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The
reader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached
on these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-
punishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the
various stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also
a taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries
to reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-
els. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959
analyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:

        In 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones
    level of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that
    "it was not too high in relation to underlying values." When we
    approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that
    year had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked
    ourselves the same question--namely, "whether in our opinion the
    level of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high
    for sound investment." In the light of the subsequent spectacular
    advance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no
    means easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-
    tiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that
    "from the standpoint of value indications--our chief investment
    guide--the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable."
    But we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages
    had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the
A Century of Stock-Market History                                       73

past, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting these
factors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-
tious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-
ularly brilliant counsel. A good prophet would have foreseen that
the market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the
next five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if
any of those whose business was stock-market forecasting--as
ours was not--had any better inkling than we did of what lay
ahead.

    At the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high
of 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be
summarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):
"In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-
ent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous
because prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the
case the market's momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to
unjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the
future in which there will never be any serious losses, and in
which, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock
purchases."

    The caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-
fied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet
it was far from fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961;
then fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;
advanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic
to 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period
of six months. At the same time there was a far more serious
shrinkage in the most popular "growth stocks"--as evidenced by
the striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business
Machines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in
June 1962.

    This period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched
common stocks of small enterprises--the so-called hot issues--
which had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices
and then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to
levels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the
quotations in just a few months.

    The collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not
disastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps
74             The Intelligent Investor

    to many more imprudent people who called themselves "in-
    vestors." But the turnabout that came later that year was equally
    unsuspected by the financial community. The stock-market aver-
    ages resumed their upward course, producing the following
    sequence:

December 1961  DJIA                       Standard & Poor's
June 1962                                500-Stock Composite
November 1964   735
                536                               72.64
                892                               52.32
                                                  86.28

        The recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was
    indeed remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall
    Street sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had
    appeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to
    the end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.
    But at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms
    was again manifest; nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish
    side, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.

   We then approached the task of appraising the November 1964
levels of the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing
it learnedly from numerous angles we reached three main con-
clusions. The first was that "old standards (of valuation) appear
inapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time."
The second was that the investor "must base his policy on the
existence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the
extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in
the market's level--say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the
other hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni-
tude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450"
(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We
said: "Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how
could we say that any price level is too high?" And the chapter
closed as follows:

WHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW

    Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan-
gerous merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh
our reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from
most competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end
each one must make his own decision and accept responsibility
therefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to
which course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The
principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-
lowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:

1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.
2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.
3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring

   it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The
   capital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,
   and the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a
   savings deposit.

    Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide
dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their
periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel
the market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather
strongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the
late 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina
to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should
appear highly unfavorable.

   This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA
advanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a
low of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of
debacle took place in the price of "hot issues"--i.e., with declines
running as much as 90%--as had happened in the 1961­62 setback.
And, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture
appeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and
greater doubts. A single fact may summarize the story: The DJIA
closed 1970 at a level lower than six years before--the first time
such a thing had happened since 1944.
76  The Intelligent Investor

   Such were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is
there anything we and our readers can learn from them? We con-
sidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953
(but too cautiously in the latter year), "dangerous" in 1959 (at 584
for DJIA), and "too high" (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments
could be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-
ful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels--in
favor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the
one hand, and discouraging endeavors to "beat the market" or to
"pick the winners" on the other.

   Nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from
a renewed consideration of the level of the stock market--this time
as of late 1971--even if what we have to say will prove more inter-
esting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.
There is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle's Ethics that
goes: "It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of
exactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is
equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a
mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an ora-
tor." The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle
between that of a mathematician and of an orator.

   At various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood
at the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-
ous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to
use the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor's
composite index (or S & P 500), because it is more comprehensive
and representative of the general market than the 30-stock DJIA.
We shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four
dates of our former editions--namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,
1958 and 1963--plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take
the convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times
in 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.
For our earnings figures we present both the last year's showing
and the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use
the last twelve months' figures; and for 1971 bond interest and
wholesale prices those of August 1971.

   The 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in
October 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same
as in 1958, but much higher than in the early years of the long bull

market. This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-
strued to indicate that the market was especially high in January
1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought
into the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The
reader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-
ings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire
period, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,
by this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When
dividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the
relationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. In
the early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds
yield twice as much, and more, than stocks.

   Our final judgment is that the adverse change in the bond-
yield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio
for late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view
of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was
some 7 years ago--i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-
point of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the
1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)

   In terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still
appear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-
fered in 1969­1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a
new stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in
1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during
1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of
low-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968­1970 cycle, it is too
early (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.
Hence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is
lacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November
1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-
look would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the
900 DJIA level before the next serious setback or collapse. But we
cannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,
the early-1971-market's disregard of the harrowing experiences of
less than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness
go unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-
cult times ahead--perhaps in the form of a fairly quick replay of
the the 1969­1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-
market fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 3

   You've got to be careful if you don't know where you're going,
   'cause you might not get there.

                                                                      --Yogi Berra

BULL-MARKET BALONEY
In this chapter, Graham shows how prophetic he can be. He looks
two years ahead, foreseeing the "catastrophic" bear market of
1973­1974, in which U.S. stocks lost 37% of their value.1 He also
looks more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of
market gurus and best-selling books that were not even on the horizon
in his lifetime.

   The heart of Graham's argument is that the intelligent investor must
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortu-
nately, that's exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in
the 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance pro-
fessor Jeremy Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run (1994)--culminating,
in a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett's Dow
36,000, David Elias' Dow 40,000, and Charles Kadlec's Dow
100,000 (all published in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had
returned an annual average of 7% after inflation ever since 1802.
Therefore, they concluded, that's what investors should expect in the
future.

   Some bulls went further. Since stocks had "always" beaten bonds
over any period of at least 30 years, stocks must be less risky than
bonds or even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of
owning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why

quibble over how much you pay for them in the first place? (To find out
why, see the sidebar on p. 82.)

   In 1999 and early 2000, bull-market baloney was everywhere:

· On December 7, 1999, Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the
     Firsthand mutual funds, appeared on CNN's Moneyline telecast.
     Asked if wireless telecommunication stocks were overvalued--
     with many trading at infinite multiples of their earnings--Landis
     had a ready answer. "It's not a mania," he shot back. "Look at the
     outright growth, the absolute value of the growth. It's big."

· On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist
     at the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal: "It's a
     new world order. We see people discard all the right companies
     with all the right people with the right vision because their stock
     price is too high--that's the worst mistake an investor can make."

· In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Apple-
     gate, then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers,
     asked rhetorically: "Is the stock market riskier today than two
     years ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no."

   But the answer is yes. It always has been. It always will be.
   And when Graham asked, "Can such heedlessness go unpun-
ished?" he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no. Like an
enraged Greek god, the stock market crushed everyone who had
come to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some
kind of divine right. Just look at how those forecasts by Landis,
Froelich, and Applegate held up:

· From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis's pet wire-
     less stocks, Nokia, lost "only" 67%--while the worst, Winstar
     Communications, lost 99.9%.

· Froelich's favorite stocks--Cisco Systems and Motorola--fell more
     than 70% by late 2002. Investors lost over $400 billion on Cisco
     alone--more than the annual economic output of Hong Kong,
     Israel, Kuwait, and Singapore combined.

· In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the
     Dow Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite
     Index was at 4446. By the end of 2002, the Dow was hobbling
     around the 8,300 level, while NASDAQ had withered to roughly
     1300--eradicating all its gains over the previous six years.
            S U RVIVAL OF TH E FATTE ST

There was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have "always"
beaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do
not exist. The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market's
earliest returns contain as few as seven (yes, 7!) stocks.1 By
1800, however, there were some 300 companies in America
(many in the Jeffersonian equivalents of the Internet: wooden
turnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and their investors
lost their knickers.

   But the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went
bust in those early years, a problem technically known as "sur-
vivorship bias." Thus these indexes wildly overstate the results
earned by real-life investors--who lacked the 20/20 hindsight
necessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy. A lonely
handful of companies, including Bank of New York and J. P. Mor-
gan Chase, have prospered continuously since the 1790s. But
for every such miraculous survivor, there were thousands of
financial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Penn-
sylvania Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers's Gap Turn-
pike Co.--all omitted from the "historical" stock indexes.

   Jeremy Siegel's data show that, after inflation, from 1802
through 1870 stocks gained 7.0% per year, bonds 4.8%, and
cash 5.1%. But Elroy Dimson and his colleagues at London
Business School estimate that the pre-1871 stock returns are
overstated by at least two percentage points per year.2 In the
real world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds--and
perhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term
record "proves" that stocks are guaranteed to outperform
bonds or cash is an ignoramus.

1 By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan-
cial stocks and 27 railroad stocks--still an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the
rambunctious young American stock market.
2 See Jason Zweig, "New Cause for Caution on Stocks," Time, May 6, 2002,
p. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between 1871 and
the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds of automobile,
aviation, and radio companies that went bust without a trace. These returns,
too, are probably overstated by one to two percentage points.
Commentary on Chapter 3  83

THE HIGHER THEY GO,
TH E HAR D E R TH EY FALL

As the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham
urges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.
Why should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their
past returns? When every investor comes to believe that stocks are
guaranteed to make money in the long run, won't the market end up
being wildly overpriced? And once that happens, how can future
returns possibly be high?

   Graham's answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common
sense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function
of the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering
away, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the
world was at peace. But that did not mean--nor could it ever mean--
that stocks were worth buying at any price. Since the profits that com-
panies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to
pay for stocks must also be finite.

   Think of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the great-
est basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Sta-
dium like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by
paying Jordan up to $34 million a year to bounce a big leather ball
around a wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have
been justified paying him $340 million, or $3.4 billion, or $34 billion,
per season.

THE LIMITS OF OPTIMISM

Focusing on the market's recent returns when they have been rosy,
warns Graham, will lead to "a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion
that equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks
in the future." From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least
20% each year--a surge unprecedented in American history--stock
buyers became ever more optimistic:

· In mid-1998, investors surveyed by the Gallup Organization for
     the PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn
     an average of roughly 13% over the year to come. By early 2000,
     their average expected return had jumped to more than 18%.
84  Commentary on Chapter 3

· "Sophisticated professionals" were just as bullish, jacking up their
     own assumptions of future returns. In 2001, for instance, SBC
     Communications raised the projected return on its pension plan
     from 8.5% to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return
     on the pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-
     stock index had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.

    A quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:

· Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of
     one-year returns on stocks had slumped to 7%--even though
     investors could now buy at prices nearly 50% lower than in
     2000.2

· Those gung-ho assumptions about the returns on their pension
     plans will cost the companies in the S & P 500 a bare minimum of
     $32 billion between 2002 and 2004, according to recent Wall
     Street estimates.

   Even though investors all know they're supposed to buy low and
sell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham's
warning in this chapter is simple: "By the rule of opposites," the more
enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,
the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run. On
March 24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at
$14.75 trillion. By October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, the total
U.S. stock market was worth $7.34 trillion, or 50.2% less--a loss of
$7.41 trillion. Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bear-
ish, predicting flat or even negative market returns for years--even
decades--to come.

   At this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering
how calamitously wrong the "experts" were the last time they agreed
on something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe
them now?

2 Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors' expec-
tation of a 7% stock return will be realized.
Commentary on Chapter 3  85

WHAT'S N E XT?

Instead, let's tune out the noise and think about future returns as Gra-
ham might. The stock market's performance depends on three factors:

· real growth (the rise of companies' earnings and dividends)
· inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the

     economy)
· speculative growth--or decline (any increase or decrease in the

     investing public's appetite for stocks)

   In the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share
has averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).3 As of early 2003,
inflation was running around 2.4% annually; the dividend yield on
stocks was 1.9%. So,

                                     1.5% to 2%
                                             + 2.4%
                                             + 1.9%

                                  = 5.8% to 6.3%

   In the long run, that means you can reasonably expect stocks to
average roughly a 6% return (or 4% after inflation). If the investing
public gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that
speculative fever will temporarily drive returns higher. If, instead,
investors are full of fear, as they were in the 1930s and 1970s, the
returns on stocks will go temporarily lower. (That's where we are in
2003.)

   Robert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham
inspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of
the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index against average corporate
profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the histori-
cal record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20,
the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well

3 See Jeremy Siegel, Stocks for the Long Run (McGraw-Hill, 2002), p. 94,
and Robert Arnott and William Bernstein, "The Two Percent Dilution," work-
ing paper, July, 2002.
86               Commentary on Chapter 3

below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road. In
early 2003, by Shiller's math, stocks were priced at about 22.8 times
the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decade--still in the
danger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times
earnings in December 1999.

   How has the market done in the past when it was priced around
today's levels? Figure 3-1 shows the previous periods when stocks
were at similar highs, and how they fared over the 10-year stretches
that followed:

Commentary on Chapter 3  87

   So, from valuation levels similar to those of early 2003, the stock
market has sometimes done very well in the ensuing 10 years, some-
times poorly, and muddled along the rest of the time. I think Graham,
ever the conservative, would split the difference between the lowest
and highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks
will earn roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that
projection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added
together real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.)
Compared to the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it's a whisker better
than the gains that bonds are likely to produce--and reason enough for
most investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.

   But there is a second lesson in Graham's approach. The only thing
you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that
you will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that
the past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us--always!
And the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will
most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their
views about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecast-
ing powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a
view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.

   So, by all means, you should lower your expectations--but take care
not to depress your spirit. For the intelligent investor, hope always
springs eternal, because it should. In the financial markets, the worse
the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be. A cynic once told
G. K. Chesterton, the British novelist and essayist, "Blessed is he who
expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed." Chesterton's
rejoinder? "Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy
everything."
CHAPTER 4

General Portfolio Policy:

The Defensive Investor

The basic characteristics of an investment portfolio are usually

determined by the position and characteristics of the owner or
owners. At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance
companies, and so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago their
investments were limited by law in many states to high-grade
bonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other
extreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,
who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-
vided he considers it an attractive purchase.

   It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot
afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return
on their invested funds. From this there has developed the general
notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is
more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.
Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-
dent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-
ing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes
to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from
concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and
enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and
skill. In 1965 we added: "In many cases there may be less real risk
associated with buying a `bargain issue' offering the chance of a
large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about
41/2%." This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-
pected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bonds
lost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in
interest rates.

The Basic Problem of Bond-Stock Allocation

   We have already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of
the defensive investor.* He should divide his funds between high-
grade bonds and high-grade common stocks.

   We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the
investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his
funds in common stocks, with a consequent inverse range of
between 75% and 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that
the standard division should be an equal one, or 50­50, between
the two major investment mediums. According to tradition the
sound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks
would be the appearance of the "bargain price" levels created in a
protracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call
for reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in
the judgment of the investor the market level has become danger-
ously high.

   These copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate
and always difficult to follow--because they go against that very
human nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear mar-
kets. It is almost a contradiction in terms to suggest as a feasible
policy for the average stockowner that he lighten his holdings when
the market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after
a corresponding decline. It is because the average man operates,
and apparently must operate, in opposite fashion that we have had
the great advances and collapses of the past; and--this writer
believes--we are likely to have them in the future.

   If the division between investment and speculative operations
were as clear now as once it was, we might be able to envisage
investors as a shrewd, experienced group who sell out to the heed-
less, hapless speculators at high prices and buy back from them at
depressed levels. This picture may have had some verisimilitude in
bygone days, but it is hard to identify it with financial develop-
ments since 1949. There is no indication that such professional
operations as those of the mutual funds have been conducted in
this fashion. The percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the

* See Graham's "Conclusion" to Chapter 2, p. 56­57.
90  The Intelligent Investor

two major types of funds--"balanced" and "common-stock"--has
changed very little from year to year. Their selling activities have
been largely related to endeavors to switch from less to more
promising holdings.

   If, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact
with its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established,
then we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce
his common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild
them later to the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the
investor should not have more than one-half in equities unless he
has strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is
sure that he could view a market decline of the 1969­70 type with
equanimity. It is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can
be justified at the levels existing in early 1972. Thus we would
counsel against a greater than 50% apportionment to common
stocks at this time. But, for complementary reasons, it is almost
equally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%,
unless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current
market level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in
any further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.

   We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may
appear to be an oversimplified 50­50 formula. Under this plan the
guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi-
sion between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the mar-
ket level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%,
the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock
portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a
fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use
of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.

   Yale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number
of years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% "normal hold-
ing" in common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to
have given up its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its
portfolio in equities (including some convertibles). (At that time
the endowment funds of 71 such institutions, totaling $7.6 billion,
held 60.3% in common stocks.) The Yale example illustrates the
almost lethal effect of the great market advance upon the once pop-
ular formula approach to investment. Nonetheless we are convinced
that our 50­50 version of this approach makes good sense for the
General Portfolio Policy  91

defensive investor. It is extremely simple; it aims unquestionably in
the right direction; it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least
making some moves in response to market developments; most
important of all, it will restrain him from being drawn more and
more heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and
more dangerous heights.

   Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with
the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a
severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how
much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.

   While our proposed 50­50 division is undoubtedly the simplest
"all-purpose program" devisable, it may not turn out to be the best
in terms of results achieved. (Of course, no approach, mechanical
or otherwise, can be advanced with any assurance that it will work
out better than another.) The much larger income return now
offered by good bonds than by representative stocks is a potent
argument for favoring the bond component. The investor's choice
between 50% or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on
his own temperament and attitude. If he can act as a cold-blooded
weigher of the odds, he would be likely to favor the low 25% stock
component at this time, with the idea of waiting until the DJIA div-
idend yield was, say, two-thirds of the bond yield before he would
establish his median 50­50 division between bonds and stocks.
Starting from 900 for the DJIA and dividends of $36 on the unit,
this would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 71/2% to
about 5.5% without any change in the present return on leading
stocks, or a fall in the DJIA to as low as 660 if there is no reduction
in bond yields and no increase in dividends. A combination of
intermediate changes could produce the same "buying point." A
program of that kind is not especially complicated; the hard part is
to adopt it and to stick to it not to mention the possibility that it
may turn out to have been much too conservative.

The Bond Component

   The choice of issues in the bond component of the investor's
portfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy tax-
able or tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-term
maturities? The tax decision should be mainly a matter of arith-
92  The Intelligent Investor

metic, turning on the difference in yields as compared with the
investor's tax bracket. In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturi-
ties was between obtaining, say, 71/2% on "grade Aa" corporate
bonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term "municipals" is
generally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including
state obligations.) There was thus for this maturity a loss in income
of some 30% in passing from the corporate to the municipal field.
Hence if the investor was in a maximum tax bracket higher than
30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic-
ipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A
single person starts paying a 30% rate when his income after
deductions passes $10,000; for a married couple the rate applies
when combined taxable income passes $20,000. It is evident that a
large proportion of individual investors would obtain a higher
return after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate
bonds.

   The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a
different question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself
against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a
lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable
gain in principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in
Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.

   For a period of many years in the past the only sensible bond
purchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety
was--and is--unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other
bond investments of first quality; they had a money-back option
and other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In
our earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled "U.S. Savings
Bonds: A Boon to Investors."

   As we shall point out, U.S. savings bonds still possess certain
unique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ-
ual investor. For the man of modest capital--with, say, not more
than $10,000 to put into bonds--we think they are still the easiest
and the best choice. But those with larger funds may find other
mediums more desirable.

   Let us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con-
sideration, and discuss them briefly with respect to general
description, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and
other features.
General Portfolio Policy  93

   1. u.s. savings bonds, series e and series h. We shall first sum-
marize their important provisions, and then discuss briefly the
numerous advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly
convenient investments. The Series H bonds pay interest semi-
annually, as do other bonds. The rate is 4.29% for the first year, and
then a flat 5.10% for the next nine years to maturity. Interest on the
Series E bonds is not paid out, but accrues to the holder through
increase in redemption value. The bonds are sold at 75% of their
face value, and mature at 100% in 5 years 10 months after purchase.
If held to maturity the yield works out at 5%, compounded semi-
annually. If redeemed earlier, the yield moves up from a minimum
of 4.01% in the first year to an average of 5.20% in the next 45/6 years.

   Interest on the bonds is subject to Federal income tax, but is
exempt from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the
Series E bonds may be paid at the holder's option either annually
as the interest accrues (through higher redemption value), or not
until the bond is actually disposed of.

   Owners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly
after purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series
H bonds have similar rights to cash them in at par value (cost).
Series E bonds are exchangeable for Series H bonds, with certain
tax advantages. Bonds lost, destroyed, or stolen may be replaced
without cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but liberal
provisions for co-ownership by family members make it possible
for most investors to buy as many as they can afford. Comment:
There is no other investment that combines (1) absolute assurance
of principal and interest payments, (2) the right to demand full
"money back" at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5% inter-
est rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of Series
E bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and
thus to continue to accumulate annual values at successively
higher rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long
periods has been of great dollar advantage; we calculate it has
increased the effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a
third in typical cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at
cost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low
interest rates complete protection against the shrinkage in princi-
pal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave
them the possibility of benefiting from the rise in interest rates by
94  The Intelligent Investor

switching their low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues
on an even-money basis.

   In our view the special advantages enjoyed by owners of sav-
ings bonds now will more than compensate for their lower current
return as compared with other direct government obligations.

   2. other united states bonds. A profusion of these issues exists,
covering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates. All of
them are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and
principal. They are subject to Federal income taxes but free from
state income tax. In late 1971 the long-term issues--over ten years--
showed an average yield of 6.09%, intermediate issues (three to five
years) returned 6.35%, and short issues returned 6.03%.

   In 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large dis-
counts. Some of these are accepted at par in settlement of estate
taxes. Example: The U.S. Treasury 31/2s due 1990 are in this category;
they sold at 60 in 1970, but closed 1970 above 77.

   It is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect obli-
gations of the U.S. government yield appreciably more than its
direct obligations of the same maturity. As we write, an offering
appears of 7.05% of "Certificates Fully Guaranteed by the Secretary
of Transportation of the Department of Transportation of the
United States." The yield was fully 1% more than that on direct
obligations of the U.S., maturing the same year (1986). The certifi-
cates were actually issued in the name of the Trustees of the Penn
Central Transportation Co., but they were sold on the basis of a
statement by the U.S. Attorney General that the guarantee "brings
into being a general obligation of the United States, backed by its
full faith and credit." Quite a number of indirect obligations of this
sort have been assumed by the U.S. government in the past, and all
of them have been scrupulously honored.

   The reader may wonder why all this hocus-pocus, involving an
apparently "personal guarantee" by our Secretary of Transporta-
tion, and a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end. The chief reason
for the indirection has been the debt limit imposed on govern-
ment borrowing by the Congress. Apparently guarantees by the
government are not regarded as debts--a semantic windfall for
shrewder investors. Perhaps the chief impact of this situation has
been the creation of tax-free Housing Authority bonds, enjoying
General Portfolio Policy  95

the equivalent of a U.S. guarantee, and virtually the only tax-
exempt issues that are equivalent to government bonds. Another
type of government-backed issues is the recently created New
Community Debentures, offered to yield 7.60% in September 1971.

   3. state and municipal bonds. These enjoy exemption from
Federal income tax. They are also ordinarily free of income tax in
the state of issue but not elsewhere. They are either direct obliga-
tions of a state or subdivision, or "revenue bonds" dependent for
interest payments on receipts from a toll road, bridge, building
lease, etc. Not all tax-free bonds are strongly enough protected to
justify their purchase by a defensive investor. He may be guided in
his selection by the rating given to each issue by Moody's or Stan-
dard & Poor's. One of three highest ratings by both services--Aaa
(AAA), Aa (AA), or A--should constitute a sufficient indication of
adequate safety. The yield on these bonds will vary both with the
quality and the maturity, with the shorter maturities giving the
lower return. In late 1971 the issues represented in Standard &
Poor's municipal bond index averaged AA in quality rating, 20
years in maturity, and 5.78% in yield. A typical offering of
Vineland, N.J., bonds, rated AA for A and gave a yield of only 3%
on the one-year maturity, rising to 5.8% to the 1995 and 1996 matu-
rities.1

   4. corporation bonds. These bonds are subject to both Federal
and state tax. In early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 7.19%
for a 25-year maturity, as reflected in the published yield of
Moody's Aaa corporate bond index. The so-called lower-medium-
grade issues--rated Baa--returned 8.23% for long maturities. In
each class shorter-term issues would yield somewhat less than
longer-term obligations.

   Comment. The above summaries indicate that the average
investor has several choices among high-grade bonds. Those in
high income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield
from good tax-free issues than from taxable ones. For others the
early 1972 range of taxable yield would seem to be from 5.00% on
U.S. savings bonds, with their special options, to about 71/2% on
high-grade corporate issues.
96  The Intelligent Investor

Higher-Yielding Bond Investments

   By sacrificing quality an investor can obtain a higher income
return from his bonds. Long experience has demonstrated that the
ordinary investor is wiser to keep away from such high-yield
bonds. While, taken as a whole, they may work out somewhat bet-
ter in terms of overall return than the first-quality issues, they
expose the owner to too many individual risks of untoward devel-
opments, ranging from disquieting price declines to actual default.
(It is true that bargain opportunities occur fairly often in lower-
grade bonds, but these require special study and skill to exploit
successfully.)*

   Perhaps we should add here that the limits imposed by Con-
gress on direct bond issues of the United States have produced at
least two sorts of "bargain opportunities" for investors in the pur-
chase of government-backed obligations. One is provided by the
tax-exempt "New Housing" issues, and the other by the recently
created (taxable) "New Community debentures." An offering of
New Housing issues in July 1971 yielded as high as 5.8%, free from
both Federal and state taxes, while an issue of (taxable) New Com-
munity debentures sold in September 1971 yielded 7.60%. Both
obligations have the "full faith and credit" of the United States
government behind them and hence are safe without question.
And--on a net basis--they yield considerably more than ordinary
United States bonds.

* Graham's objection to high-yield bonds is mitigated today by the wide-
spread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the research
of owning "junk bonds." See the commentary on Chapter 6 for more detail.
 The "New Housing" bonds and "New Community debentures" are no
more. New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income
tax, but they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures,
also backed by HUD, were authorized by a Federal law passed in 1968.
About $350 million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the
program was terminated in 1983.
General Portfolio Policy  97

Savings Deposits in Lieu of Bonds

   An investor may now obtain as high an interest rate from a
savings deposit in a commercial or savings bank (or from a bank
certificate of deposit) as he can from a first-grade bond of short
maturity. The interest rate on bank savings accounts may be low-
ered in the future, but under present conditions they are a suitable
substitute for short-term bond investment by the individual.

Convertible Issues

   These are discussed in Chapter 16. The price variability of bonds
in general is treated in Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctu-
ations.

Call Provisions

   In previous editions we had a fairly long discussion of this
aspect of bond financing, because it involved a serious but little
noticed injustice to the investor. In the typical case bonds were
callable fairly soon after issuance, and at modest premiums--say
5%--above the issue price. This meant that during a period of wide
fluctuations in the underlying interest rates the investor had to
bear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all
but a meager participation in favorable ones.

   Example: Our standard example has been the issue of American
Gas & Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101 in
1928. Four years later, under near-panic conditions, the price of
these good bonds fell to 621/2, yielding 8%. By 1946, in a great rever-
sal, bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3%, and the 5%
issue should have been quoted at close to 160. But at that point the
company took advantage of the call provision and redeemed the
issue at a mere 106.

   The call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised
instance of "heads I win, tails you lose." At long last, the bond-
buying institutions refused to accept this unfair arrangement; in
recent years most long-term high-coupon issues have been pro-
tected against redemption for ten years or more after issuance. This
still limits their possible price rise, but not inequitably.
98  The Intelligent Investor

   In practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to
sacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of non-
callability--say for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage
in buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-
coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For
the discount--e.g., of a 31/2% bond at 631/2%, yielding 7.85%--carries
full protection against adverse call action.

Straight--i.e., Nonconvertible--Preferred Stocks

   Certain general observations should be made here on the subject
of preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,
but they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an
inherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent
for his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-
dends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-
ted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for
the directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless
they also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-
ferred stock carries no share in the company's profits beyond the
fixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal
claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of
a common shareholder (or partner).

   These weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend
to come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a
small percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched
as to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-
situdes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is
when their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At
such times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but
too unconventional for the defensive investor.)

   In other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not
at all. We shall refer later to convertible and similarly privileged
issues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are
not ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.

   Another peculiarity in the general position of preferred stocks

* A bond's "coupon" is its interest rate; a "low-coupon" bond pays a rate of
interest income below the market average.
General Portfolio Policy  99

deserves mention. They have a much better tax status for corpora-
tion buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income
tax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the
full amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-
rate rate is 48%, this means that $100 received as preferred-stock
dividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-
est is taxed $48. On the other hand, individual investors pay
exactly the same tax on preferred-stock investments as on bond
interest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,
all investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-
rations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors
who pay income tax.*

Security Forms

   The bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto dis-
cussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. A bond-
holder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal
on a definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a
fixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-
mon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-
ified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He
may or may not have a vote.)

   The above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the
majority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable
departures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible
and similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest
does not have to be paid unless it is earned by the company.
(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-
ings, but the period is often limited to three years.)

   Income bonds should be used by corporations much more

* While Graham's logic remains valid, the numbers have changed. Corpora-
tions can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from dividends,
and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a corporation would pay
roughly $24.50 in tax on $100 in dividends from preferred stock versus
$35 in tax on $100 in interest income. Individuals pay the same rate of
income tax on dividend income that they do on interest income, so preferred
stock offers them no tax advantage.

extensively than they are. Their avoidance apparently arises from a
mere accident of economic history--namely, that they were first
employed in quantity in connection with railroad reorganizations,
and hence they have been associated from the start with financial
weakness and poor investment status. But the form itself has sev-
eral practical advantages, especially in comparison with and in
substitution for the numerous (convertible) preferred-stock issues
of recent years. Chief of these is the deductibility of the interest
paid from the company's taxable income, which in effect cuts the
cost of that form of capital in half. From the investor's standpoint it
is probably best for him in most cases that he should have (1) an
unconditional right to receive interest payments when they are
earned by the company, and (2) a right to other forms of protection
than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid. The
terms of income bonds can be tailored to the advantage of both
the borrower and the lender in the manner best suited to both.
(Conversion privileges can, of course, be included.) The acceptance
by everybody of the inherently weak preferred-stock form and
the rejection of the stronger income-bond form is a fascinating
illustration of the way in which traditional institutions and habits
often tend to persist on Wall Street despite new conditions calling
for a fresh point of view. With every new wave of optimism or
pessimism, we are ready to abandon history and time-tested prin-
ciples, but we cling tenaciously and unquestioningly to our preju-
dices.
COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 4

   When you leave it to chance, then all of a sudden you don't
   have any more luck.

                                                 --Basketball coach Pat Riley

How aggressive should your portfolio be?

   That, says Graham, depends less on what kinds of investments you
own than on what kind of investor you are. There are two ways to be
an intelligent investor:

· by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic
     mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;

· or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and
     requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).

   Graham calls the first approach "active" or "enterprising"; it takes
lots of time and loads of energy. The "passive" or "defensive" strategy
takes little time or effort but requires an almost ascetic detachment
from the alluring hullabaloo of the market. As the investment thinker
Charles Ellis has explained, the enterprising approach is physically
and intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally
demanding.1

   If you have time to spare, are highly competitive, think like a sports
fan, and relish a complicated intellectual challenge, then the active

investing on the one hand, and emotionally difficult investing on the other,

Investor," in Charles D. Ellis and James R. Vertin, eds., The Investor's Anthol-
ogy (John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 72.

approach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave simplicity,
and don't relish thinking about money, then the passive approach is for
you. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-
ods--creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly passive, or
vice versa.)

   Both approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful
with either--but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right
one, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep
your costs and emotions under control. Graham's distinction between
active and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for it--in the economy or in our
investments--but also within ourselves.

CAN YOU B E B RAVE, OR WI LL YOU CAVE?

How, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most
basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in
bonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discus-
sion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge
that inflation is one of your worst enemies.)

   The most striking thing about Graham's discussion of how to allo-
cate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions
the word "age." That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-
ventional wisdom--which holds that how much investing risk you ought
to take depends mainly on how old you are.2 A traditional rule of thumb
was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your
assets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old would
put 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%
there.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the
late 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were younger
than 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks--even if you had
only a "moderate" tolerance for risk! 3

2 A recent Google search for the phrase "age and asset allocation" turned
up more than 30,000 online references.

for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market (Times Business,
1999), p. 250.
Commentary on Chapter 4  103

   Unless you've allowed the proponents of this advice to subtract
100 from your IQ, you should be able to tell that something is wrong
here. Why should your age determine how much risk you can take?
An 89-year-old with $3 million, an ample pension, and a gaggle of
grandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds.
She already has plenty of income, and her grandchildren (who will
eventually inherit her stocks) have decades of investing ahead of
them. On the other hand, a 25-year-old who is saving for his wedding
and a house down payment would be out of his mind to put all his
money in stocks. If the stock market takes an Acapulco high dive, he
will have no bond income to cover his downside--or his backside.

   What's more, no matter how young you are, you might suddenly
need to yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now, but 40
minutes from now. Without a whiff of warning, you could lose your job,
get divorced, become disabled, or suffer who knows what other kind
of surprise. The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone
must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.

   Finally, many people stop investing precisely because the stock
market goes down. Psychologists have shown that most of us do a
very poor job of predicting today how we will feel about an emotionally
charged event in the future.4 When stocks are going up 15% or 20%
a year, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, it's easy to imagine that
you and your stocks are married for life. But when you watch every
dollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime, it's hard to resist
bailing out into the "safety" of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and
holding their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, and
holding nothing but their own head in their hands. Because so few
investors have the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market, Graham
insists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. That
cushion, he argues, will give you the courage to keep the rest of your
money in stocks even when stocks stink.

   To get a better feel for how much risk you can take, think about the
fundamental circumstances of your life, when they will kick in, when
they might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for cash:

· Are you single or married? What does your spouse or partner do
     for a living?

· Do you or will you have children? When will the tuition bills hit
     home?

· Will you inherit money, or will you end up financially responsible
     for aging, ailing parents?

· What factors might hurt your career? (If you work for a bank or a
     homebuilder, a jump in interest rates could put you out of a job. If
     you work for a chemical manufacturer, soaring oil prices could be
     bad news.)

· If you are self-employed, how long do businesses similar to yours
     tend to survive?

· Do you need your investments to supplement your cash income?
     (In general, bonds will; stocks won't.)

· Given your salary and your spending needs, how much money
     can you afford to lose on your investments?

   If, after considering these factors, you feel you can take the higher
risks inherent in greater ownership of stocks, you belong around
Graham's minimum of 25% in bonds or cash. If not, then steer mostly
clear of stocks, edging toward Graham's maximum of 75% in bonds
or cash. (To find out whether you can go up to 100%, see the
sidebar on p. 105.)

   Once you set these target percentages, change them only as your
life circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stock
market has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The
very heart of Graham's approach is to replace guesswork with disci-
pline. Fortunately, through your 401(k), it's easy to put your portfolio
on permanent autopilot. Let's say you are comfortable with a fairly high
level of risk--say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. If
the stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have
just under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.5 Visit your 401(k)'s
website (or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock
funds to "rebalance" back to your 70­30 target. The key is to rebal-
ance on a predictable, patient schedule--not so often that you will

               WHY NOT 100% STOCKS?

Graham advises you never to have more than 75% of your total
assets in stocks. But is putting all your money into the stock
market inadvisable for everyone? For a tiny minority of investors,
a 100%-stock portfolio may make sense. You are one of them
if you:

· have set aside enough cash to support your family for at least
   one year

· will be investing steadily for at least 20 years to come
· survived the bear market that began in 2000
· did not sell stocks during the bear market that began in 2000
· bought more stocks during the bear market that began in

   2000
· have read Chapter 8 in this book and implemented a formal

   plan to control your own investing behavior.

   Unless you can honestly pass all these tests, you have no
business putting all your money in stocks. Anyone who panicked
in the last bear market is going to panic in the next one--and will
regret having no cushion of cash and bonds.

drive yourself crazy, and not so seldom that your targets will get out
of whack. I suggest that you rebalance every six months, no more
and no less, on easy-to-remember dates like New Year's and the
Fourth of July.

   The beauty of this periodic rebalancing is that it forces you to base
your investing decisions on a simple, objective standard--Do I now
own more of this asset than my plan calls for?--instead of the sheer
guesswork of where interest rates are heading or whether you think
the Dow is about to drop dead. Some mutual-fund companies, includ-
ing T. Rowe Price, may soon introduce services that will automatically
rebalance your 401(k) portfolio to your preset targets, so you will
never need to make an active decision.

THE INS AND OUTS OF INCOME INVESTING

In Graham's day, bond investors faced two basic choices: Taxable or
tax-free? Short-term or long-term? Today there is a third: Bonds or
bond funds?

   Taxable or tax-free? Unless you're in the lowest tax bracket,6 you
should buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirement
accounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the
hands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your
401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no current
tax on their income--and where municipal bonds have no place, since
their tax advantage goes to waste.7

   Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on
opposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall--
although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the
other hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise--and a long-term
bond will outperform shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply

6 For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people
earning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than
$47,450.
7 Two good online calculators that will help you compare the after-tax in-
come of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.
com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To
decide if a "muni" is right for you, find the "taxable equivalent yield" gener-
ated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently
available on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds is
higher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any case,
be warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-
mum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the
advantages of municipal bonds.

of maturities, is another way of hedging interest-rate risk.

by buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 years--which
do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into
the ground either. For most investors, intermediate bonds are the sim-
plest choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing
what interest rates will do.

   Bonds or bond funds? Since bonds are generally sold in $10,000
lots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the
risk that any one of them might go bust, buying individual bonds
makes no sense unless you have at least $100,000 to invest. (The
only exception is bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, since they're pro-
tected against default by the full force of the American government.)

   Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification, along with the
convenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into
the fund at current rates without paying a commission. For most
investors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the main
exceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major
firms like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price offer a broad
menu of bond funds at low cost.9

   The choices for bond investors have proliferated like rabbits, so
let's update Graham's list of what's available. As of 2003, interest
rates have fallen so low that investors are starved for yield, but there
are ways of amplifying your interest income without taking on exces-
sive risk.10 Figure 4-1 summarizes the pros and cons.

   Now let's look at a few types of bond investments that can fill spe-
cial needs.

CASH IS NOT TRASH

How can you wring more income out of your cash? The intelligent
investor should consider moving out of bank certificates of deposit or
money-market accounts--which have offered meager returns lately--
into some of these cash alternatives:

          virtually no credit risk--since, instead of defaulting on his debts, Uncle
          Sam can just jack up taxes or print more money at will. Treasury bills
          mature in four, 13, or 26 weeks. Because of their very short maturities,
          T-bills barely get dented when rising interest rates knock down the
          prices of other income investments; longer-term Treasury debt, how-
          ever, suffers severely when interest rates rise. The interest income on
          Treasury securities is generally free from state (but not Federal)
          income tax. And, with $3.7 trillion in public hands, the market for Trea-
          sury debt is immense, so you can readily find a buyer if you need your
          money back before maturity. You can buy Treasury bills, short-term
          notes, and long-term bonds directly from the government, with no bro-
          kerage fees, at www.publicdebt.treas.gov. (For more on inflation-
          protected TIPS, see the commentary on Chapter 2.)

             Savings bonds, unlike Treasuries, are not marketable; you cannot

sell them to another investor, and you'll forfeit three months of interest
if you redeem them in less than five years. Thus they are suitable
mainly as "set-aside money" to meet a future spending need--a gift for
a religious ceremony that's years away, or a jump start on putting your
newborn through Harvard. They come in denominations as low as
$25, making them ideal as gifts to grandchildren. For investors who
can confidently leave some cash untouched for years to come, infla-
tion-protected "I-bonds" recently offered an attractive yield of around

   Mortgage securities. Pooled together from thousands of mort-
gages around the United States, these bonds are issued by agencies
like the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") or the
Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"). However,
they are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, so they sell at higher yields to
reflect their greater risk. Mortgage bonds generally underperform when
interest rates fall and bomb when rates rise. (Over the long run, those
swings tend to even out and the higher average yields pay off.) Good
mortgage-bond funds are available from Vanguard, Fidelity, and Pimco.
But if a broker ever tries to sell you an individual mortgage bond or
"CMO," tell him you are late for an appointment with your proctologist.

   Annuities. These insurance-like investments enable you to defer cur-
rent taxes and capture a stream of income after you retire. Fixed annuities
offer a set rate of return; variable ones provide a fluctuating return. But
what the defensive investor really needs to defend against here are the
hard-selling insurance agents, stockbrokers, and financial planners who
peddle annuities at rapaciously high costs. In most cases, the high
expenses of owning an annuity--including "surrender charges" that gnaw
away at your early withdrawals--will overwhelm its advantages. The few
good annuities are bought, not sold; if an annuity produces fat commis-
sions for the seller, chances are it will produce meager results for the
buyer. Consider only those you can buy directly from providers with rock-
bottom costs like Ameritas, TIAA-CREF, and Vanguard.11

of 50 who expect to be in a high tax bracket during retirement or who have

   Preferred stock. Preferred shares are a worst-of-both-worlds
investment. They are less secure than bonds, since they have only a
secondary claim on a company's assets if it goes bankrupt. And they
offer less profit potential than common stocks do, since companies
typically "call" (or forcibly buy back) their preferred shares when inter-
est rates drop or their credit rating improves. Unlike the interest pay-
ments on most of its bonds, an issuing company cannot deduct
preferred dividend payments from its corporate tax bill. Ask yourself: If
this company is healthy enough to deserve my investment, why is it
paying a fat dividend on its preferred stock instead of issuing bonds
and getting a tax break? The likely answer is that the company is not
healthy, the market for its bonds is glutted, and you should approach
its preferred shares as you would approach an unrefrigerated dead
fish.

   Common stock. A visit to the stock screener at http://screen.
yahoo.com/stocks.html in early 2003 showed that 115 of the stocks in
the Standard & Poor's 500 index had dividend yields of 3.0% or
greater. No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for yield, would
ever buy a stock for its dividend income alone; the company and its
businesses must be solid, and its stock price must be reasonable.
But, thanks to the bear market that began in 2000, some leading
stocks are now outyielding Treasury bonds. So even the most defen-
sive investor should realize that selectively adding stocks to an all-
bond or mostly-bond portfolio can increase its income yield--and raise
its potential return.12

The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

Investment Merits of Common Stocks

   In our first edition (1949) we found it necessary at this point
to insert a long exposition of the case for including a substantial
common-stock component in all investment portfolios.* Common
stocks were generally viewed as highly speculative and therefore
unsafe; they had declined fairly substantially from the high levels
of 1946, but instead of attracting investors to them because of their
reasonable prices, this fall had had the opposite effect of undermin-
ing confidence in equity securities. We have commented on the
converse situation that has developed in the ensuing 20 years,
whereby the big advance in stock prices made them appear safe
and profitable investments at record high levels which might actu-
ally carry with them a considerable degree of risk.

   The argument we made for common stocks in 1949 turned on

* At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by stocks
over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term Treasury
bonds--meaning that $10,000 invested in stocks would have grown to
$18,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have
turned into $21,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous
time to buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best long-term
returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.
 Graham's earlier comments on this subject appear on pp. 19­20. Just
imagine what he would have thought about the stock market of the late
1990s, in which each new record-setting high was considered further
"proof" that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!

112

two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable
degree of protection against the erosion of the investor's dollar
caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The
second advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average
return to investors over the years. This was produced both by an
average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and
by an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the
years in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.

   While these two advantages have been of major importance--
and have given common stocks a far better record than bonds
over the long-term past--we have consistently warned that these
benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price
for his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years
for the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it
had abysmally fallen in 1929­1932.* Since 1957 common stocks
have once again, through their high prices, lost their traditional
advantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates. It remains to

* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17
on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,
1954--more than a quarter of a century later--when it hit 382.74. (When you
say you intend to own stocks "for the long run," do you realize just how long
the long run can be--or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no
longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested
their income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,
simply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-
ing to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London
Business School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent
all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.
But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have
been worth $16,797! Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the
greatest force in stock investing.
 Why do the "high prices" of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock's
yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common
stock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100
per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price doubles while the dividend
stays constant, the dividend yield will drop to 1%. In 1959, when the trend
Graham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone, most Wall Street
114  The Intelligent Investor

be seen whether the inflation factor and the economic-growth fac-
tor will make up in the future for this significantly adverse devel-
opment.

   It should be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm
for common stocks in general at the 900 DJIA level of late 1971. For
reasons already given* we feel that the defensive investor cannot
afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks
in his portfolio, even if he must regard them as the lesser of two
evils--the greater being the risks attached to an all-bond holding.

Rules for the Common-Stock Component

   The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive
investor should be a relatively simple matter. Here we would sug-
gest four rules to be followed:

   1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversifica-
tion. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a
maximum of about thirty.

   2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and con-
servatively financed. Indefinite as these adjectives must be, their
general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the
end of the chapter.

   3. Each company should have a long record of continuous divi-
dend payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-

pundits declared that it could not possibly last. Never before had stocks
yielded less than bonds; after all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why
would anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to com-
pensate for their greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield
stocks for a few months at most, and then things would revert to "normal."
More than four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again;
the yield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on
bonds.

Chapter 14 (p. 368).
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks  115

age met this dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this
point we would suggest the requirement of continuous dividend
payments beginning at least in 1950.*

   4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will
pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the
past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such
average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last
twelve-month period. But such a restriction would eliminate
nearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port-
folio. In particular, it would ban virtually the entire category of
"growth stocks," which have for some years past been the favorites
of both speculators and institutional investors. We must give our
reasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.

Growth Stocks and the Defensive Investor

   The term "growth stock" is applied to one which has increased
its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common
stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future.
(Some authorities would say that a true growth stock should be
expected at least to double its per-share earnings in ten years--i.e.,
to increase them at a compounded annual rate of over 7.1%.)
Obviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own, pro-
vided the price paid is not excessive. The problem lies there, of

* Today's defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of
continuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from consideration
only one member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average--Microsoft--and
would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500
index). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would
not be overly restrictive; according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in
the S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.
 The "Rule of 72" is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an
amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth rate
into 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by
6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its
earnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1 years).
116  The Intelligent Investor

course, since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation
to current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average
profits over a past period. This has introduced a speculative ele-
ment of considerable weight in the growth-stock picture and has
made successful operations in this field a far from simple matter.

   The leading growth issue has long been International Business
Machines, and it has brought phenomenal rewards to those who
bought it years ago and held on to it tenaciously. But we have
already pointed out* that this "best of common stocks" actually
lost 50% of its market price in a six-months' decline during 1961­62
and nearly the same percentage in 1969­70. Other growth stocks
have been even more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some
cases not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well,
thus causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them. A
good second example for our purpose is Texas Instruments, which
in six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a dividend, while its
earnings increased from 40 cents to $3.91 per share. (Note that the
price advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is characteristic
of popular common stocks.) But two years later the earnings had
dropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths, to 49.

   The reader will understand from these instances why we regard
growth stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for
the defensive investor. Of course, wonders can be accomplished
with the right individual selections, bought at the right levels, and
later sold after a huge rise and before the probable decline. But the
average investor can no more expect to accomplish this than to find
money growing on trees. In contrast we think that the group of

* Graham makes this point on p. 73.
 To show that Graham's observations are perennially true, we can substi-
tute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty years apart,
the results are uncannily similar: Microsoft's stock dropped 55.7% from
2000 through 2002, while Cisco's stock--which had risen roughly 50-fold
over the previous six years--lost 76% of its value from 2000 through 2002.
As with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco's stock price was sharper than
the fall in its earnings, which dropped just 39.2% (comparing the three-year
average for 1997­1999 against 2000­2002). As always, the hotter they
are, the harder they fall.
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks  117

large companies that are relatively unpopular, and therefore
obtainable at reasonable earnings multipliers,* offers a sound if
unspectacular area of choice by the general public. We shall illus-
trate this idea in our chapter on portfolio selection.

Portfolio Changes

   It is now standard practice to submit all security lists for peri-
odic inspection in order to see whether their quality can be
improved. This, of course, is a major part of the service provided
for clients by investment counselors. Nearly all brokerage houses
are ready to make corresponding suggestions, without special fee,
in return for the commission business involved. Some brokerage
houses maintain investment services on a fee basis.

   Presumably our defensive investor should obtain--at least once
a year--the same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio
as he sought when his funds were first committed. Since he will
have little expertness of his own on which to rely, it is essential that
he entrust himself only to firms of the highest reputation; other-
wise he may easily fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands. It
is important, in any case, that at every such consultation he make
clear to his adviser that he wishes to adhere closely to the four
rules of common-stock selection given earlier in this chapter. Inci-
dentally, if his list has been competently selected in the first
instance, there should be no need for frequent or numerous
changes.

* "Earnings multiplier" is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios, which
measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared to the
profitability of the underlying business. (See footnote  on p. 70 in Chapter 3.)
 Investors can now set up their own automated system to monitor the
quality of their holdings by using interactive "portfolio trackers" at such web-
sites as www.quicken.com, moneycentral.msn.com, finance.yahoo.com, and
www.morningstar.com. Graham would, however, warn against relying exclu-
sively on such a system; you must use your own judgment to supplement
the software.
118  The Intelligent Investor

Dollar-Cost Averaging

   The New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into
popularizing its "monthly purchase plan," under which an
investor devotes the same dollar amount each month to buying
one or more common stocks. This is an application of a special type
of "formula investment" known as dollar-cost averaging. During
the predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results
from such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-
cially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his
buying at the wrong times.

   In Lucile Tomlinson's comprehensive study of formula invest-
ment plans,1 the author presented a calculation of the results of
dollar-cost averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow
Jones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-
chase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test
showed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within
five years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the
23 buying periods was 21.5%, exclusive of dividends received.
Needless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-
rary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-
sion of this ultrasimple investment formula with the striking
sentence: "No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-
ing which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate suc-
cess, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar
Cost Averaging."

   It may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in
principle, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so
situated that they can have available for common-stock investment
the same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to
me that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent
years. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-
sary component of a sound savings-investment program. Thus,
systematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present
no more psychological and financial difficulties than similar con-
tinuous payments for United States savings bonds and for life
insurance--to which they should be complementary. The monthly
amount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be
impressive and important to the saver.
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks  119

The Investor's Personal Situation

   At the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the posi-
tion of the individual portfolio owner. Let us return to this matter,
in the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what
extent should the type of securities selected by the investor vary
with his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely
different conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with
which to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in
mid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly accretions of
$10,000; and (3) a young man earning $200 per week and saving
$1,000 a year.*

   For the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-
ficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her
investments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally
between United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a
compromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-
eral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component
may be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-
pared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not
buying at too high a level. Assuredly this is not the case in early
1972.)

   We do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify
as an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-
ods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must not do is
to take speculative chances in order to "make some extra income."
By this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-
essary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. It
would be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-
cipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in
poorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.

   The prosperous doctor has none of the widow's pressures and
compulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the
same. Is he willing to take a serious interest in the business of
investment? If he lacks the impulse or the flair, he will do best to

* To update Graham's figures, take each dollar amount in this section and
multiply it by five.
120  The Intelligent Investor

accept the easy role of the defensive investor. The division of his
portfolio should then be no different from that of the "typical"
widow, and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix-
ing the size of the stock component. The annual savings should be
invested in about the same proportions as the total fund.

   The average doctor may be more likely than the average widow
to elect to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more
likely to succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handi-
cap, however--the fact that he has less time available to give to his
investment education and to the administration of his funds. In
fact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-
rity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample
confidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a
good return on their money, without the realization that to do so
successfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and
something of a professional approach to security values.

   Finally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year--and expects to
do better gradually--finds himself with the same choices, though
for still different reasons. Some of his savings should go automati-
cally into Series E bonds. The balance is so modest that it seems
hardly worthwhile for him to undergo a tough educational and
temperamental discipline in order to qualify as an aggressive
investor. Thus a simple resort to our standard program for the
defensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi-
cal policy.

   Let us not ignore human nature at this point. Finance has a fasci-
nation for many bright young people with limited means. They
would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement
of their savings, even though investment income is much less
important to them than their salaries. This attitude is all to the
good. There is a great advantage for the young capitalist to begin
his financial education and experience early. If he is going to oper-
ate as an aggressive investor he is certain to make some mistakes
and to take some losses. Youth can stand these disappointments
and profit by them. We urge the beginner in security buying not to
waste his efforts and his money in trying to beat the market. Let
him study security values and initially test out his judgment on
price versus value with the smallest possible sums.

   Thus we return to the statement, made at the outset, that the
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks  121

kind of securities to be purchased and the rate of return to be
sought depend not on the investor's financial resources but on his
financial equipment in terms of knowledge, experience, and tem-
perament.

Note on the Concept of "Risk"

   It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good
preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common
stocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-
mon stocks because they are not "safe," which was demonstrated
in the Federal Reserve Board's survey of 1948. We should like to
point out that the words "risk" and "safety" are applied to securi-
ties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.

   A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or
principal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-
mon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-
dend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the
dividend means that it has proved unsafe. It is also true that an
investment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility that the
holder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.

   Nevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-
sible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may
be of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder
is unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-
ent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to
a greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior
issues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a
true risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a
mortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he
were forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not
taken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-
estate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual
payments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-
mercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not
by what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.

   In Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide
investor does not lose money merely because the market price of
his holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does
122  The Intelligent Investor

not mean that he is running a true risk of loss. If a group of well-
selected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall
return, as measured through a fair number of years, then this
group investment has proved to be "safe." During that period its
market value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell
for a while under the buyer's cost. If that fact makes the investment
"risky," it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the
same time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept
of risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through
actual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the
company's position--or, more frequently perhaps, is the result of
the payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth
of the security.2

   Many common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But
it is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com-
mon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that
therefore it should not be termed "risky" merely because of the ele-
ment of price fluctuation. But such risk is present if there is danger
that the price may prove to have been clearly too high by intrinsic-
value standards--even if any subsequent severe market decline
may be recouped many years later.

Note on the Category of "Large, Prominent,
and Conservatively Financed Corporations"

   The quoted phrase in our caption was used earlier in the chapter
to describe the kind of common stocks to which defensive
investors should limit their purchases--provided also that they
had paid continuous dividends for a considerable number of years.
A criterion based on adjectives is always ambiguous. Where is the
dividing line for size, for prominence, and for conservatism of
financial structure? On the last point we can suggest a specific stan-
dard that, though arbitrary, is in line with accepted thinking. An
industrial company's finances are not conservative unless the com-
mon stock (at book value) represents at least half of the total capi-
talization, including all bank debt.3 For a railroad or public utility
the figure should be at least 30%.

   The words "large" and "prominent" carry the notion of substan-
tial size combined with a leading position in the industry. Such
The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks  123

companies are often referred to as "primary"; all other common
stocks are then called "secondary," except that growth stocks are
ordinarily placed in a separate class by those who buy them as
such. To supply an element of concreteness here, let us suggest that
to be "large" in present-day terms a company should have $50 mil-
lion of assets or do $50 million of business.* Again to be "promi-
nent" a company should rank among the first quarter or first third
in size within its industry group.

   It would be foolish, however, to insist upon such arbitrary crite-
ria. They are offered merely as guides to those who may ask for
guidance. But any rule which the investor may set for himself and
which does no violence to the common-sense meanings of "large"
and "prominent" should be acceptable. By the very nature of the
case there must be a large group of companies that some will and
others will not include among those suitable for defensive invest-
ment. There is no harm in such diversity of opinion and action. In
fact, it has a salutary effect upon stock-market conditions, because
it permits a gradual differentiation or transition between the cate-
gories of primary and secondary stock issues.

* In today's markets, to be considered large, a company should have a total
stock value (or "market capitalization") of at least $10 billion. According to
the online stock screener at http://screen.yahoo.com/stocks.html, that gave
you roughly 300 stocks to choose from as of early 2003.
COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 5

   Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great Pieces of good
   Fortune that seldom happen, as by little Advantages that occur
   every day.

                                                            --Benjamin Franklin

THE BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE

After the stock-market bloodbath of the past few years, why would any
defensive investor put a dime into stocks?

   First, remember Graham's insistence that how defensive you should
be depends less on your tolerance for risk than on your willingness to
put time and energy into your portfolio. And if you go about it the right
way, investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds
and cash. (As we'll see in Chapter 9, you can buy a stock-market index
fund with no more effort than it takes to get dressed in the morning.)

   Amidst the bear market that began in 2000, it's understandable if
you feel burned--and if, in turn, that feeling makes you determined
never to buy another stock again. As an old Turkish proverb says,
"After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt."
Because the crash of 2000­2002 was so terrible, many investors
now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of
crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot
milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.

   Viewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has
nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning
them a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to
give you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the
losses they may have cost you in the recent past. That's all the more
true when bond yields are low, reducing the future returns on income-
producing investments.

124
Commentary on Chapter 5  125

   As we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only
mildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their
supposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himself
against lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. No matter how
defensive an investor you are--in Graham's sense of low maintenance,
or in the contemporary sense of low risk--today's values mean that you
must keep at least some of your money in stocks.

   Fortunately, it's never been easier for a defensive investor to buy
stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest-
ments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part of
your life to stock picking.

S H OU LD YOU "B UY WHAT YOU K N OW"?

But first, let's look at something the defensive investor must always
defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any
homework. In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular
investing slogans was "buy what you know." Peter Lynch--who from
1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record
ever compiled by a mutual fund--was the most charismatic preacher of
this gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage
that professional investors have forgotten how to use: "the power of
common knowledge." If you discover a great new restaurant, car,
toothpaste, or jeans--or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby
business is always full or that people are still working at a company's
headquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air--then you have a per-
sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-
ager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, "During a lifetime of
buying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what's good and
what's bad, what sells and what doesn't . . . and the most important
part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it." 1

   Lynch's rule--"You can outperform the experts if you use your edge
by investing in companies or industries you already understand"--isn't

totally implausible, and thousands of investors have profited from it
over the years. But Lynch's rule can work only if you follow its corollary
as well: "Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next
step is doing the research." To his credit, Lynch insists that no one
should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or
how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements
and estimating its business value.

   Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.
   Barbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people
abuse Lynch's teachings. In 1999 she burbled, "We go to Starbucks
every day, so I buy Starbucks stock." But the Funny Girl forgot that no
matter how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to ana-
lyze Starbucks's financial statements and make sure the stock isn't
even more overpriced than the coffee. Countless stock buyers made
the same mistake by loading up on shares of Amazon.com because
they loved the website or buying e*Trade stock because it was their
own online broker.
   "Experts" gave the idea credence too. In an interview televised on
CNN in late 1999, portfolio manager Kevin Landis of the Firsthand
Funds was asked plaintively, "How do you do it? Why can't I do it,
Kevin?" (From 1995 through the end of 1999, the Firsthand Technol-
ogy Value fund produced an astounding 58.2% average annualized
gain.) "Well, you can do it," Landis chirped. "All you really need to do is
focus on the things that you know, and stay close to an industry, and
talk to people who work in it every day." 2
   The most painful perversion of Lynch's rule occurred in corporate
retirement plans. If you're supposed to "buy what you know," then
what could possibly be a better investment for your 401(k) than your
own company's stock? After all, you work there; don't you know more
about the company than an outsider ever could? Sadly, the employees

eastern standard time. If Landis's own record is any indication, focusing on
"the things that you know" is not "all you really need to do" to pick stocks
successfully. From the end of 1999 through the end of 2002, Landis's fund
(full of technology companies that he claimed to know "firsthand" from his
base in Silicon Valley) lost 73.2% of its value, an even worse pounding than
the average technology fund suffered over that period.

of Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom--many of whom put nearly
all their retirement assets in their own company's stock, only to be
wiped out--learned that insiders often possess only the illusion of
knowledge, not the real thing.

   Psychologists led by Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity have documented a disturbing fact: becoming more familiar with a
subject does not significantly reduce people's tendency to exaggerate
how much they actually know about it.3 That's why "investing in what
you know" can be so dangerous; the more you know going in, the less
likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses. This pernicious form of
overconfidence is called "home bias," or the habit of sticking to what is
already familiar:

· Individual investors own three times more shares in their local
     phone company than in all other phone companies combined.

· The typical mutual fund owns stocks whose headquarters are 115
     miles closer to the fund's main office than the average U.S. com-
     pany is.

· 401(k) investors keep between 25% and 30% of their retirement
     assets in the stock of their own company.4

   In short, familiarity breeds complacency. On the TV news, isn't it
always the neighbor or the best friend or the parent of the criminal who
says in a shocked voice, "He was such a nice guy"? That's because
whenever we are too close to someone or something, we take our
beliefs for granted, instead of questioning them as we do when we con-
front something more remote. The more familiar a stock is, the more
likely it is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who thinks there's
no need to do any homework. Don't let that happen to you.

CAN YOU ROLL YOU R OWN?

Fortunately, for a defensive investor who is willing to do the required
homework for assembling a stock portfolio, this is the Golden Age:
Never before in financial history has owning stocks been so cheap
and convenient.5

   Do it yourself. Through specialized online brokerages like www.
sharebuilder.com, www.foliofn.com, and www.buyandhold.com, you
can buy stocks automatically even if you have very little cash to spare.
These websites charge as little as $4 for each periodic purchase of
any of the thousands of U.S. stocks they make available. You can
invest every week or every month, reinvest the dividends, and even
trickle your money into stocks through electronic withdrawals from
your bank account or direct deposit from your paycheck. Sharebuilder
charges more to sell than to buy--reminding you, like a little whack
across the nose with a rolled-up newspaper, that rapid selling is an
investing no-no--while FolioFN offers an excellent tax-tracking tool.

   Unlike traditional brokers or mutual funds that won't let you in the door
for less than $2,000 or $3,000, these online firms have no minimum
account balances and are tailor-made for beginning investors who want
to put fledgling portfolios on autopilot. To be sure, a transaction fee of
$4 takes a monstrous 8% bite out of a $50 monthly investment--but if
that's all the money you can spare, then these microinvesting sites are
the only game in town for building a diversified portfolio.

   You can also buy individual stocks straight from the issuing compa-
nies. In 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission loos-
ened the handcuffs it had long ago clamped onto the direct sale of
stocks to the public. Hundreds of companies responded by creating
Internet-based programs allowing investors to buy shares without
going through a broker. Some helpful online sources of information on
buying stocks directly include www.dripcentral.com, www.netstock
direct.com (an affiliate of Sharebuilder), and www.stockpower.com.

5 According to finance professor Charles Jones of Columbia Business
School, the cost of a small, one-way trade (either a buy or a sell) in a New
York Stock Exchange­listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in Graham's
day to about 0.25% in 2000. For institutions like mutual funds, those costs
are actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, "A Century of Stock Market Li-
quidity and Trading Costs," at http://papers.ssrn.com.)
Commentary on Chapter 5  129

You may often incur a variety of nuisance fees that can exceed $25
per year. Even so, direct-stock purchase programs are usually cheaper
than stockbrokers.

   Be warned, however, that buying stocks in tiny increments for years
on end can set off big tax headaches. If you are not prepared to keep
a permanent and exhaustively detailed record of your purchases, do
not buy in the first place. Finally, don't invest in only one stock--or even
just a handful of different stocks. Unless you are not willing to spread
your bets, you shouldn't bet at all. Graham's guideline of owning
between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors
who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you
are not overexposed to one industry.6 (For more on how to pick the
individual stocks that will make up your portfolio, see pp. 114­115
and Chapters 11, 14, and 15.)

   If, after you set up such an online autopilot portfolio, you find your-
self trading more than twice a year--or spending more than an hour or
two per month, total, on your investments--then something has gone
badly wrong. Do not let the ease and up-to-the-minute feel of the Inter-
net seduce you into becoming a speculator. A defensive investor
runs--and wins--the race by sitting still.

   Get some help. A defensive investor can also own stocks through
a discount broker, a financial planner, or a full-service stockbroker. At a
discount brokerage, you'll need to do most of the stock-picking work
yourself; Graham's guidelines will help you create a core portfolio
requiring minimal maintenance and offering maximal odds of a steady
return. On the other hand, if you cannot spare the time or summon the
interest to do it yourself, there's no reason to feel any shame in hiring
someone to pick stocks or mutual funds for you. But there's one
responsibility that you must never delegate. You, and no one but you,
must investigate (before you hand over your money) whether an
adviser is trustworthy and charges reasonable fees. (For more point-
ers, see Chapter 10.)

   Farm it out. Mutual funds are the ultimate way for a defensive
investor to capture the upside of stock ownership without the down-

130  Commentary on Chapter 5

side of having to police your own portfolio. At relatively low cost, you
can buy a high degree of diversification and convenience--letting a
professional pick and watch the stocks for you. In their finest form--
index portfolios--mutual funds can require virtually no monitoring or
maintenance whatsoever. Index funds are a kind of Rip Van Winkle
investment that is highly unlikely to cause any suffering or surprises
even if, like Washington Irving's lazy farmer, you fall asleep for 20
years. They are a defensive investor's dream come true. For more
detail, see Chapter 9.

FILLING IN THE POTHOLES

As the financial markets heave and crash their way up and down day
after day, the defensive investor can take control of the chaos. Your
very refusal to be active, your renunciation of any pretended ability to
predict the future, can become your most powerful weapons. By put-
ting every investment decision on autopilot, you drop any self-delusion
that you know where stocks are headed, and you take away the
market's power to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces.

   As Graham notes, "dollar-cost averaging" enables you to put a fixed
amount of money into an investment at regular intervals. Every week,
month, or calendar quarter, you buy more--whether the markets have
gone (or are about to go) up, down, or sideways. Any major mutual fund
company or brokerage firm can automatically and safely transfer the
money electronically for you, so you never have to write a check or feel
the conscious pang of payment. It's all out of sight, out of mind.

   The ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index
funds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you
renounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going
but which sectors of the market--and which particular stocks or bonds
within them--will do the best.

   Let's say you can spare $500 a month. By owning and dollar-cost
averaging into just three index funds--$300 into one that holds the
total U.S. stock market, $100 into one that holds foreign stocks, and
$100 into one that holds U.S. bonds--you can ensure that you own
almost every investment on the planet that's worth owning.7 Every

7 For more on the rationale for keeping a portion of your portfolio in foreign
stocks, see pp. 186­187.
Commentary on Chapter 5  131

month, like clockwork, you buy more. If the market has dropped, your
preset amount goes further, buying you more shares than the month
before. If the market has gone up, then your money buys you fewer
shares. By putting your portfolio on permanent autopilot this way, you
prevent yourself from either flinging money at the market just when it is
seems most alluring (and is actually most dangerous) or refusing to
buy more after a market crash has made investments truly cheaper
(but seemingly more "risky").

   According to Ibbotson Associates, the leading financial research
firm, if you had invested $12,000 in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you would
have had only $7,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry $100
and simply invested another $100 every single month, then by August
1939, your money would have grown to $15,571! That's the power of
disciplined buying--even in the face of the Great Depression and the
worst bear market of all time.8

   Figure 5-1 shows the magic of dollar-cost averaging in a more re-
cent bear market.

   Best of all, once you build a permanent autopilot portfolio with
index funds as its heart and core, you'll be able to answer every mar-
ket question with the most powerful response a defensive investor
could ever have: "I don't know and I don't care." If someone asks
whether bonds will outperform stocks, just answer, "I don't know and I
don't care"--after all, you're automatically buying both. Will health-care
stocks make high-tech stocks look sick? "I don't know and I don't
care"--you're a permanent owner of both. What's the next Microsoft?
"I don't know and I don't care"--as soon as it's big enough to own,
your index fund will have it, and you'll go along for the ride. Will foreign
stocks beat U.S. stocks next year? "I don't know and I don't care"--if
they do, you'll capture that gain; if they don't, you'll get to buy more at
lower prices.

   By enabling you to say "I don't know and I don't care," a permanent
autopilot portfolio liberates you from the feeling that you need to fore-
cast what the financial markets are about to do--and the illusion that

Although it was not possible for retail investors to buy the entire S & P 500
index until 1976, the example nevertheless proves the power of buying more
when stock prices go down.

CHAPTER 6

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising

Investor: Negative Approach

The "aggressive" investor should start from the same base as the

defensive investor, namely, a division of his funds between high-
grade bonds and high-grade common stocks bought at reasonable
prices.* He will be prepared to branch out into other kinds of secu-
rity commitments, but in each case he will want a well-reasoned
justification for the departure. There is a difficulty in discussing
this topic in orderly fashion, because there is no single or ideal pat-
tern for aggressive operations. The field of choice is wide; the selec-
tion should depend not only on the individual's competence and
equipment but perhaps equally well upon his interests and prefer-
ences.

   The most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are
of a negative sort. Let him leave high-grade preferred stocks to cor-
porate buyers. Let him also avoid inferior types of bonds and pre-
ferred stocks unless they can be bought at bargain levels--which
means ordinarily at prices at least 30% under par for high-coupon

* Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in Chapter 1
that the definition of an "enterprising" investor depends not on the amount
of risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing to put in, Graham
falls back on the conventional notion that enterprising investors are more
"aggressive." The rest of the chapter, however, makes clear that Graham
stands by his original definition. (The great British economist John Maynard
Keynes appears to have been the first to use the term "enterprise" as a syn-
onym for analytical investment.)

                                                                                            133
134  The Intelligent Investor

issues, and much less for the lower coupons.* He will let someone
else buy foreign-government bond issues, even though the yield
may be attractive. He will also be wary of all kinds of new issues,
including convertible bonds and preferreds that seem quite tempt-
ing and common stocks with excellent earnings confined to the
recent past.

   For standard bond investments the aggressive investor would
do well to follow the pattern suggested to his defensive confrere,
and make his choice between high-grade taxable issues, which can
now be selected to yield about 71/4%, and good-quality tax-free
bonds, which yield up to 5.30% on longer maturities.

Second-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks

   Since in late-1971 it is possible to find first-rate corporate bonds
to yield 71/4%, and even more, it would not make much sense to buy
second-grade issues merely for the higher return they offer. In fact
corporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir-
tually impossible to sell "straight bonds"--i.e., nonconvertibles--
to the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has
been done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants
attached), which place them in a separate category. It follows that
virtually all the nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent
older issues which are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer
the possibility of a substantial gain in principal value under favor-
able future conditions--which would mean here a combination of
an improved credit rating for the company and lower general
interest rates.

* "High-coupon issues" are corporate bonds paying above-average interest
rates (in today's markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks paying large divi-
dend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high rates of interest in
order to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal that it is risky. For more
on high-yield or "junk" bonds, see pp. 145­147.
 As of early 2003, the equivalent yields are roughly 5.1% on high-grade
corporate bonds and 4.7% on 20-year tax-free municipal bonds. To up-
date these yields, see www.bondsonline.com/asp/news/composites/html or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.html and www.bloomberg.com/markets/
psamuni.html.
        Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 135

   But even in the matter of price discounts and resultant chance of
principal gain, the second-grade bonds are in competition with bet-
ter issues. Some of the well-entrenched obligations with "old-
style" coupon rates (21/2% to 4%) sold at about 50 cents on the dollar
in 1970. Examples: American Telephone & Telegraph 25/8s, due 1986
sold at 51; Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe RR 4s, due 1995, sold at 51;
McGraw-Hill 37/8s, due 1992, sold at 501/2.

   Hence under conditions of late-1971 the enterprising investors
can probably get from good-grade bonds selling at a large discount
all that he should reasonably desire in the form of both income and
chance of appreciation.

   Throughout this book we refer to the possibility that any well-
defined and protracted market situation of the past may return in
the future. Hence we should consider what policy the aggressive
investor might have to choose in the bond field if prices and yields
of high-grade issues should return to former normals. For this rea-
son we shall reprint here our observations on that point made in
the 1965 edition, when high-grade bonds yielded only 41/2%.

   Something should be said now about investing in second-grade
issues, which can readily be found to yield any specified return up
to 8% or more. The main difference between first- and second-
grade bonds is usually found in the number of times the interest
charges have been covered by earnings. Example: In early 1964
Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific 5% income debenture
bonds, at 68, yielded 7.35%. But the total interest charges of the
road, before income taxes, were earned only 1.5 times in 1963,
against our requirement of 5 times for a well-protected railroad
issue.1

   Many investors buy securities of this kind because they "need
income" and cannot get along with the meager return offered by
top-grade issues. Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy
a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because
the yield is attractive.* (Here the word "merely" implies that the
issue is not selling at a large discount and thus does not offer an
opportunity for a substantial gain in principal value.) Where such
securities are bought at full prices--that is, not many points under

100 *--the chances are very great that at some future time the
holder will see much lower quotations. For when bad business
comes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove highly sus-
ceptible to severe sinking spells; often interest or dividends are
suspended or at least endangered, and frequently there is a pro-
nounced price weakness even though the operating results are not
at all bad.

   As a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality
senior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten
railroad income bonds in 1946­47. These comprise all of those which
sold at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 1021/2. By the
following year the group had registered low prices averaging only
68, a loss of one-third of the market value in a very short time.
Peculiarly enough, the railroads of the country were showing
much better earnings in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price
decline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of
the selloff in the general market. But it should be pointed out that
the shrinkage in these income bonds was proportionately larger
than that in the common stocks in the Dow Jones industrial list
(about 23%). Obviously the purchaser of these bonds at a cost
above 100 could not have expected to participate to any extent in a
further rise in the securities market. The only attractive feature was
the income yield, averaging about 4.25% (against 2.50% for first-
grade bonds, an advantage of 1.75% in annual income). Yet the
sequel showed all too soon and too plainly that for the minor
advantage in annual income the buyer of these second-grade
bonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal.

   The above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu-
lar fallacy that goes under the sobriquet of a "businessman's
investment." That involves the purchase of a security showing a
larger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying
a correspondingly greater risk. It is bad business to accept an

* Bond prices are quoted in percentages of "par value," or 100. A bond
priced at "85" is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond originally
offered for $10,000, but now selling at 85, will cost $8,500. When bonds
sell below 100, they are called "discount" bonds; above 100, they become
"premium" bonds.
        Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 137

acknowledged possibility of a loss of principal in exchange for a
mere 1 or 2% of additional yearly income. If you are willing to
assume some risk you should be certain that you can realize a
really substantial gain in principal value if things go well. Hence a
second-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost always a bad
purchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense--and if you
are patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.

   Second-grade bonds and preferred stocks possess two contra-
dictory attributes which the intelligent investor must bear clearly
in mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On
the other hand, a large proportion recover their position when
favorable conditions return, and these ultimately "work out all
right." This is true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to
pay dividends for many years. There were a number of such issues
in the early 1940s, as a consequence of the long depression of the
1930s. During the postwar boom period of 1945­1947 many of
these large accumulations were paid off either in cash or in new
securities, and the principal was often discharged as well. As a
result, large profits were made by people who, a few years previ-
ously, had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold
at low prices.2

   It may well be true that, in an overall accounting, the higher
yields obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have
offset those principal losses that were irrecoverable. In other
words, an investor who bought all such issues at their offering
prices might conceivably fare as well, in the long run, as one who
limited himself to first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3

   But for practical purposes the question is largely irrelevant.
Regardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full
prices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines
precipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure
an "average" result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of
his larger income to offset or "amortize" those principal losses
which prove to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to
abstain from buying securities at around 100 if long experience
indicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next
weak market.

Foreign Government Bonds

   All investors with even small experience know that foreign
bonds, as a whole, have had a bad investment history since 1914.
This was inevitable in the light of two world wars and an interven-
ing world depression of unexampled depth. Yet every few years
market conditions are sufficiently favorable to permit the sale of
some new foreign issues at a price of about par. This phenomenon
tells us a good deal about the working of the average investor's
mind--and not only in the field of bonds.

   We have no concrete reason to be concerned about the future his-
tory of well-regarded foreign bonds such as those of Australia or
Norway. But we do know that, if and when trouble should come,
the owner of foreign obligations has no legal or other means of
enforcing his claim. Those who bought Republic of Cuba 41/2s as
high as 117 in 1953 saw them default their interest and then sell as
low as 20 cents on the dollar in 1963. The New York Stock
Exchange bond list in that year also included Belgian Congo 51/4s at
36, Greek 7s at 30, and various issues of Poland as low as 7. How
many readers have any idea of the repeated vicissitudes of the 8%
bonds of Czechoslovakia, since they were first offered in this coun-
try in 1922 at 961/2? They advanced to 112 in 1928, declined to 673/4 in
1932, recovered to 106 in 1936, collapsed to 6 in 1939, recovered
(unbelievably) to 117 in 1946, fell promptly to 35 in 1948, and sold
as low as 8 in 1970!

   Years ago an argument of sorts was made for the purchase of
foreign bonds here on the grounds that a rich creditor nation such
as ours was under moral obligation to lend abroad. Time, which
brings so many revenges, now finds us dealing with an intractable
balance-of-payments problem of our own, part of which is ascrib-
able to the large-scale purchase of foreign bonds by American
investors seeking a small advantage in yield. For many years past
we have questioned the inherent attractiveness of such invest-
ments from the standpoint of the buyer; perhaps we should add
now that the latter would benefit both his country and himself if he
declined these opportunities.
        Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 139

New Issues Generally

   It might seem ill-advised to attempt any broad statements about
new issues as a class, since they cover the widest possible range of
quality and attractiveness. Certainly there will be exceptions to any
suggested rule. Our one recommendation is that all investors
should be wary of new issues--which means, simply, that these
should be subjected to careful examination and unusually severe
tests before they are purchased.

   There are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that
new issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls
therefore for a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that
most new issues are sold under "favorable market conditions"--
which means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor-
able for the buyer.

   The effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor-
tant as we go down the scale from the highest-quality bonds
through second-grade senior issues to common-stock flotations at
the bottom. A tremendous amount of financing, consisting of the
repayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by
new issues with lower coupons, was done in the past. Most of this
was in the category of high-grade bonds and preferred stocks. The
buyers were largely financial institutions, amply qualified to pro-
tect their interests. Hence these offerings were carefully priced to

* New issues of common stock--initial public offerings or IPOs--normally are
sold with an "underwriting discount" (a built-in commission) of 7%. By con-
trast, the buyer's commission on older shares of common stock typically
ranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes roughly twice as much for
selling something new as it does for selling something old, the new will get
the harder sell.
 Recently, finance professors Owen Lamont of the University of Chicago
and Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that corpora-
tions choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near
a peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see Lamont's "Evaluating
Value Weighting: Corporate Events and Market Timing" and Schultz's
"Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance of IPOs" at http://
papers.ssrn.com.
140  The Intelligent Investor

meet the going rate for comparable issues, and high-powered
salesmanship had little effect on the outcome. As interest rates fell
lower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for
these issues, and many of them later declined appreciably in the
market. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu-
rities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer;
but in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the purchaser
are likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.

   The situation proves somewhat different when we study the
lower-grade bonds and preferred stocks sold during the 1945­46
and 1960­61 periods. Here the effect of the selling effort is more
apparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with
individual and inexpert investors. It was characteristic of these
offerings that they did not make an adequate showing when
judged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-
ber of years. They did look safe enough, for the most part, if it
could be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without
a serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these
issues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen
had little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers
to a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-
ment, and one likely to prove costly.

   Bull-market periods are usually characterized by the transfor-
mation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-
panies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945­46 and again
beginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-
tions until brought to a catastrophic close in May 1962. After the
usual "swearing-off" period of several years the whole tragicom-
edy was repeated, step by step, in 1967­1969.*

* In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850 com-
panies sold their stock to the public for the first time--an average of more than
one per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again; in 1969 an aston-
ishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped create the bear
markets of 1969 and 1973­1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that
only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.
That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when
roughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market--helping to trigger the over-

New Common-Stock Offerings

   The following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the
1959 edition, with comment added:

        Common-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case
    of companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata
    to the existing stockholders. The subscription price is set below
    the current market, and the "rights" to subscribe have an initial
    money value.* The sale of the new shares is almost always under-
    written by one or more investment banking houses, but it is the
    general hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken
    by the exercise of the subscription rights. Thus the sale of addi-
    tional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call
    for active selling effort on the part of distributing firms.

        The second type is the placement with the public of common
    stock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of
    this stock is sold for the account of the controlling interests to
    enable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their

enthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash. Then the cycle swung the other way
again as IPOs dried up in 1988­1990. That shortage contributed to the bull
market of the 1990s--and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-
ness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the
bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001--the lowest annual
total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has
stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-
ing. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through
this manic-depressive cycle. In America's first great IPO boom, back in 1825,
a man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-
lators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-
ers hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by
1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.
* Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already
own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same
proportional interest in the company. This form of financing, still widespread
in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except among closed-end
funds.
142  The Intelligent Investor

own finances. (When new money is raised for the business it
comes often via the sale of preferred stock, as previously noted.)
This activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of
the security markets must bring many losses and disappointments
to the public. The dangers arise both from the character of the
businesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions
that make the financing possible.

    In the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading
companies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the
number of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held
steadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have
tended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-
cerns. By an unfortunate correlation, during the same period the
stock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference
for the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor
ones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as
bull markets are built up; the large and quick profits shown by
common stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public's critical
faculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive instinct. During these
periods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be
found that are enjoying excellent results--although most of these
would not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-
ried back, say, ten years or more.

    When these factors are put together the following consequences
emerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first
common-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced
not unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of
the early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing
grows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily
poorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One
fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the
fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies
are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for
many medium-sized companies with a long market history. (It
should be added that very little of this common-stock financing is
ordinarily done by banking houses of prime size and reputation.)*

* In Graham's day, the most prestigious investment banks generally steered
clear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified exploita-
        Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 143

        The heedlessness of the public and the willingness of selling
    organizations to sell whatever may be profitably sold can have
    only one result--price collapse. In many cases the new issues lose
    75% and more of their offering price. The situation is worsened by
    the aforementioned fact that, at bottom, the public has a real aver-
    sion to the very kind of small issue that it bought so readily in its
    careless moments. Many of these issues fall, proportionately, as
    much below their true value as they formerly sold above it.

        An elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil-
    ity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-
    stock issues during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found
    that can pass severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad pol-
    icy to get mixed up in this sort of business. Of course the salesman
    will point to many such issues which have had good-sized market
    advances--including some that go up spectacularly the very day
    they are sold. But all this is part of the speculative atmosphere. It is
    easy money. For every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky
    if you end up by losing only two.

        Some of these issues may prove excellent buys--a few years
    later, when nobody wants them and they can be had at a small
    fraction of their true worth.

   In the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject
as follows:

        While the broader aspects of the stock market's behavior since
    1949 have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long expe-
    rience, the development of new common-stock flotations pro-
    ceeded exactly in accordance with ancient prescription. It is
    doubtful whether we ever before had so many new issues offered,
    of such low quality, and with such extreme price collapses, as we

tion of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late 1999 and early
2000, however, Wall Street's biggest investment banks had jumped in with
both feet. Venerable firms cast off their traditional prudence and behaved
like drunken mud wrestlers, scrambling to foist ludicrously overvalued
stocks on a desperately eager public. Graham's description of how the IPO
process works is a classic that should be required reading in investment-
banking ethics classes, if there are any.
144  The Intelligent Investor

experienced in 1960­1962.4 The ability of the stock market as a
whole to disengage itself rapidly from that disaster is indeed an
extraordinary phenomenon, bringing back long-buried memories
of the similar invulnerability it showed to the great Florida real-
estate collapse in 1925.

    Must there be a return of the new-stock-offering madness
before the present bull market can come to its definitive close?
Who knows? But we do know that an intelligent investor will not
forget what happened in 1962 and will let others make the next
batch of quick profits in this area and experience the consequent
harrowing losses.

   We followed these paragraphs in the 1965 edition by citing "A
Horrible Example," namely, the sale of stock of Aetna Maintenance
Co. at $9 in November 1961. In typical fashion the shares promptly
advanced to $15; the next year they fell to 23/8, and in 1964 to 7/8. The
later history of this company was on the extraordinary side, and
illustrates some of the strange metamorphoses that have taken
place in American business, great and small, in recent years. The
curious reader will find the older and newer history of this enter-
prise in Appendix 5.

   It is by no means difficult to provide even more harrowing
examples taken from the more recent version of "the same old
story," which covered the years 1967­1970. Nothing could be more
pat to our purpose than the case of AAA Enterprises, which hap-
pens to be the first company then listed in Standard & Poor's Stock
Guide. The shares were sold to the public at $14 in 1968, promptly
advanced to 28, but in early 1971 were quoted at a dismal 25¢.
(Even this price represented a gross overvaluation of the enter-
prise, since it had just entered the bankruptcy court in a hopeless
condition.) There is so much to be learned, and such important
warnings to be gleaned, from the story of this flotation that we
have reserved it for detailed treatment below, in Chapter 17.
COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 6

   The punches you miss are the ones that wear you out.
                                            --Boxing trainer Angelo Dundee

For the aggressive as well as the defensive investor, what you don't

do is as important to your success as what you do. In this chapter,
Graham lists his "don'ts" for aggressive investors. Here is a list for
today.

J U N K YA R D D O G S ?
High-yield bonds--which Graham calls "second-grade" or "lower-
grade" and today are called "junk bonds"--get a brisk thumbs-down
from Graham. In his day, it was too costly and cumbersome for an indi-
vidual investor to diversify away the risks of default.1 (To learn how bad
a default can be, and how carelessly even "sophisticated" profes-
sional bond investors can buy into one, see the sidebar on p. 146.)
Today, however, more than 130 mutual funds specialize in junk bonds.
These funds buy junk by the cartload; they hold dozens of different
bonds. That mitigates Graham's complaints about the difficulty of
diversifying. (However, his bias against high-yield preferred stock
remains valid, since there remains no cheap and widely available way
to spread their risks.)

   Since 1978, an annual average of 4.4% of the junk-bond market
has gone into default--but, even after those defaults, junk bonds have

1 In the early 1970s, when Graham wrote, there were fewer than a dozen
junk-bond funds, nearly all of which charged sales commissions of up to
8.5%; some even made investors pay a fee for the privilege of reinvesting
their monthly dividends back into the fund.

                     A WORLD OF HURT
               FOR WORLDCOM BONDS

Buying a bond only for its yield is like getting married only for the
sex. If the thing that attracted you in the first place dries up,
you'll find yourself asking, "What else is there?" When the
answer is "Nothing," spouses and bondholders alike end up with
broken hearts.

   On May 9, 2001, WorldCom, Inc. sold the biggest offering
of bonds in U.S. corporate history--$11.9 billion worth. Among
the eager beavers attracted by the yields of up to 8.3% were
the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the
world's largest pension funds; Retirement Systems of Alabama,
whose managers later explained that "the higher yields" were
"very attractive to us at the time they were purchased"; and the
Strong Corporate Bond Fund, whose comanager was so fond
of WorldCom's fat yield that he boasted, "we're getting paid
more than enough extra income for the risk." 1

   But even a 30-second glance at WorldCom's bond prospec-
tus would have shown that these bonds had nothing to offer but
their yield--and everything to lose. In two of the previous five
years WorldCom's pretax income (the company's profits before
it paid its dues to the IRS) fell short of covering its fixed charges
(the costs of paying interest to its bondholders) by a stupen-
dous $4.1 billion. WorldCom could cover those bond payments
only by borrowing more money from banks. And now, with this
mountainous new helping of bonds, WorldCom was fattening
its interest costs by another $900 million per year!2 Like Mr.
Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, WorldCom
was gorging itself to the bursting point.

   No yield could ever be high enough to compensate an investor
for risking that kind of explosion. The WorldCom bonds did pro-
duce fat yields of up to 8% for a few months. Then, as Graham
would have predicted, the yield suddenly offered no shelter:

· WorldCom filed bankruptcy in July 2002.
· WorldCom admitted in August 2002 that it had overstated

   its earnings by more than $7 billion.3
Commentary on Chapter 6  147

· WorldCom's bonds defaulted when the company could no
   longer cover their interest charges; the bonds lost more than
   80% of their original value.

still produced an annualized return of 10.5%, versus 8.6% for 10-year
U.S. Treasury bonds.2 Unfortunately, most junk-bond funds charge
high fees and do a poor job of preserving the original principal amount
of your investment. A junk fund could be appropriate if you are retired,
are looking for extra monthly income to supplement your pension, and
can tolerate temporary tumbles in value. If you work at a bank or other
financial company, a sharp rise in interest rates could limit your raise or
even threaten your job security--so a junk fund, which tends to outper-
form most other bond funds when interest rates rise, might make
sense as a counterweight in your 401(k). A junk-bond fund, though, is
only a minor option--not an obligation--for the intelligent investor.

THE VODKA-AND-BURRITO PORTFOLIO

Graham considered foreign bonds no better a bet than junk bonds.3
Today, however, one variety of foreign bond may have some appeal for
investors who can withstand plenty of risk. Roughly a dozen mutual
funds specialize in bonds issued in emerging-market nations (or what
used to be called "Third World countries") like Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russia, and Venezuela. No sane investor would put more than 10% of
a total bond portfolio in spicy holdings like these. But emerging-
markets bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock market,
so they are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely
because the Dow is down. That can give you a small corner of comfort
in your portfolio just when you may need it most.4

DYI N G A TRAD E R'S D EATH

As we've already seen in Chapter 1, day trading--holding stocks for a
few hours at a time--is one of the best weapons ever invented for com-
mitting financial suicide. Some of your trades might make money, most
of your trades will lose money, but your broker will always make
money.

   And your own eagerness to buy or sell a stock can lower your
return. Someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up
having to bid 10 cents higher than the most recent share price before
any sellers will be willing to part with it. That extra cost, called "market
impact," never shows up on your brokerage statement, but it's real. If
you're overeager to buy 1,000 shares of a stock and you drive its price

3 Graham did not criticize foreign bonds lightly, since he spent several years
early in his career acting as a New York­based bond agent for borrowers in
Japan.
4 Two low-cost, well-run emerging-markets bond funds are Fidelity New
Markets Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond Fund;
for more information, see www.fidelity.com, www.troweprice.com, and www.
morningstar.com. Do not buy any emerging-markets bond fund with annual
operating expenses higher than 1.25%, and be forewarned that some of
these funds charge short-term redemption fees to discourage investors from
holding them for less than three months.

up by just five cents, you've just cost yourself an invisible but very real
$50. On the flip side, when panicky investors are frantic to sell a stock
and they dump it for less than the most recent price, market impact
hits home again.

   The costs of trading wear away your returns like so many swipes of
sandpaper. Buying or selling a hot little stock can cost 2% to 4% (or
4% to 8% for a "round-trip" buy-and-sell transaction).5 If you put
$1,000 into a stock, your trading costs could eat up roughly $40
before you even get started. Sell the stock, and you could fork over
another 4% in trading expenses.

   Oh, yes--there's one other thing. When you trade instead of invest,
you turn long-term gains (taxed at a maximum capital-gains rate of
20%) into ordinary income (taxed at a maximum rate of 38.6%).

   Add it all up, and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10% just to
break even on buying and selling a stock.6 Anyone can do that once,
by luck alone. To do it often enough to justify the obsessive attention it
requires--plus the nightmarish stress it generates--is impossible.

   Thousands of people have tried, and the evidence is clear: The
more you trade, the less you keep.

   Finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the Univer-
sity of California examined the trading records of more than 66,000
customers of a major discount brokerage firm. From 1991 through
1996, these clients made more than 1.9 million trades. Before the
costs of trading sandpapered away at their returns, the people in the
study actually outperformed the market by an average of at least half a
percentage point per year. But after trading costs, the most active of
these traders--who shifted more than 20% of their stock holdings per

Monica, California, and its website, www.plexusgroup.com. Plexus argues
persuasively that, just as most of the mass of an iceberg lies below the
ocean surface, the bulk of brokerage costs are invisible--misleading
investors into believing that their trading costs are insignificant if commis-
sion costs are low. The costs of trading NASDAQ stocks are considerably
higher for individuals than the costs of trading NYSE-listed stocks (see
p. 128, footnote 5).

income taxes in this example.

month--went from beating the market to underperforming it by an
abysmal 6.4 percentage points per year. The most patient investors,
however--who traded a minuscule 0.2% of their total holdings in
an average month--managed to outperform the market by a whisker,
even after their trading costs. Instead of giving a huge hunk of their
gains away to their brokers and the IRS, they got to keep almost
everything.7 For a look at these results, see Figure 6-1.

   The lesson is clear: Don't just do something, stand there. It's time
for everyone to acknowledge that the term "long-term investor" is
redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is.
Someone who can't hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a
time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.

Among the get-rich-quick toxins that poisoned the mind of the invest-
ing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the idea that you
can build wealth by buying IPOs. An IPO is an "initial public offering,"
or the first sale of a company's stock to the public. At first blush,
investing in IPOs sounds like a great idea--after all, if you'd bought
100 shares of Microsoft when it went public on March 13, 1986, your
$2,100 investment would have grown to $720,000 by early 2003.8
And finance professors Jay Ritter and William Schwert have shown
that if you had spread a total of only $1,000 across every IPO in Janu-
ary 1960, at its offering price, sold out at the end of that month,
then invested anew in each successive month's crop of IPOs, your
portfolio would have been worth more than $533 decillion by year-
end 2001.

        $533,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.)

                                    Unfortunately, for every IPO like Microsoft that turns out to be a big
                                 winner, there are thousands of losers. The psychologists Daniel Kahn-
                                 erman and Amos Tversky have shown when humans estimate the like-
                                 lihood or frequency of an event, we make that judgment based not on
                                 how often the event has actually occurred, but on how vivid the past
                                 examples are. We all want to buy "the next Microsoft"--precisely
                                 because we know we missed buying the first Microsoft. But we con-
                                 veniently overlook the fact that most other IPOs were terrible invest-
                                 ments. You could have earned that $533 decillion gain only if you
                                 never missed a single one of the IPO market's rare winners--a practi-

cal impossibility. Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured
by members of an exclusive private club--the big investment banks
and fund houses that get shares at the initial (or "underwriting") price,
before the stock begins public trading. The biggest "run-ups" often
occur in stocks so small that even many big investors can't get any
shares; there just aren't enough to go around.

   If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after
their shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, your
results will be terrible. From 1980 through 2001, if you had bought
the average IPO at its first public closing price and held on for three
years, you would have underperformed the market by more than 23
percentage points annually.9

   Perhaps no stock personifies the pipe dream of getting rich from
IPOs better than VA Linux. "LNUX THE NEXT MSFT," exulted an early
owner; "BUY NOW, AND RETIRE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW." 10
On December 9, 1999, the stock was placed at an initial public offer-
ing price of $30. But demand for the shares was so ferocious that
when NASDAQ opened that morning, none of the initial owners of VA
Linux would let go of any shares until the price hit $299. The stock
peaked at $320 and closed at $239.25, a gain of 697.5% in a single
day. But that gain was earned by only a handful of institutional traders;
individual investors were almost entirely frozen out.

   More important, buying IPOs is a bad idea because it flagrantly vio-
lates one of Graham's most fundamental rules: No matter how many
other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if the stock is a
cheap way to own a desirable business. At the peak price on day one,
investors were valuing VA Linux's shares at a total of $12.7 billion.
What was the company's business worth? Less than five years old,
VA Linux had sold a cumulative total of $44 million worth of its soft-
ware and services--but had lost $25 million in the process. In its most
recent fiscal quarter, VA Linux had generated $15 million in sales but

             had lost $10 million on them. This business, then, was losing almost
             70 cents on every dollar it took in. VA Linux's accumulated deficit (the
             amount by which its total expenses had exceeded its income) was
             $30 million.

                If VA Linux were a private company owned by the guy who lives
             next door, and he leaned over the picket fence and asked you how
             much you would pay to take his struggling little business off his hands,
             would you answer, "Oh, $12.7 billion sounds about right to me"? Or
             would you, instead, smile politely, turn back to your barbecue grill, and
             wonder what on earth your neighbor had been smoking? Relying
             exclusively on our own judgment, none of us would be caught dead
             agreeing to pay nearly $13 billion for a money-loser that was already
             $30 million in the hole.

                But when we're in public instead of in private, when valuation sud-
             denly becomes a popularity contest, the price of a stock seems more
             important than the value of the business it represents. As long as
             someone else will pay even more than you did for a stock, why does it
             matter what the business is worth?

                This chart shows why it matters.

   After going up like a bottle rocket on that first day of trading, VA
Linux came down like a buttered brick. By December 9, 2002, three
years to the day after the stock was at $239.50, VA Linux closed at
$1.19 per share.

   Weighing the evidence objectively, the intelligent investor should
conclude that IPO does not stand only for "initial public offering." More
accurately, it is also shorthand for:

It's Probably Overpriced,
Imaginary Profits Only,
Insiders' Private Opportunity, or
Idiotic, Preposterous, and Outrageous.

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising
Investor: The Positive Side

The enterprising investor, by definition, will devote a fair amount

of his attention and efforts toward obtaining a better than run-of-
the-mill investment result. In our discussion of general investment
policy we have made some suggestions regarding bond investments
that are addressed chiefly to the enterprising investor. He might be
interested in special opportunities of the following kinds:

(1) Tax-free New Housing Authority bonds effectively guaranteed
     by the United States government.

(2) Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds, also guar-
     anteed by the United States government.

(3) Tax-free industrial bonds issued by municipalities, but ser-
     viced by lease payments made by strong corporations.

   References have been made to these unusual types of bond
issues in Chapter 4.*

   At the other end of the spectrum there may be lower-quality
bonds obtainable at such low prices as to constitute true bargain
opportunities. But these would belong in the "special situation"
area, where no true distinction exists between bonds and common
stocks.

* As already noted (see p. 96, footnote ), the New Housing Authority and
New Community bonds are no longer issued.
 Today these "lower-quality bonds" in the "special situation" area are
known as distressed or defaulted bonds. When a company is in (or

                                                                                            155
156  The Intelligent Investor

Operations in Common Stocks

   The activities specially characteristic of the enterprising investor
in the common-stock field may be classified under four heads:

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
2. Buying carefully chosen "growth stocks"
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into "special situations"

General Market Policy--Formula Timing

   We reserve for the next chapter our discussion of the possibili-
ties and limitations of a policy of entering the market when it is
depressed and selling out in the advanced stages of a boom. For
many years in the past this bright idea appeared both simple and
feasible, at least from first inspection of a market chart covering its
periodic fluctuations. We have already admitted ruefully that the
market's action in the past 20 years has not lent itself to operations
of this sort on any mathematical basis. The fluctuations that have
taken place, while not inconsiderable in extent, would have
required a special talent or "feel" for trading to take advantage of
them. This is something quite different from the intelligence which
we are assuming in our readers, and we must exclude operations
based on such skill from our terms of reference.

   The 50­50 plan, which we proposed to the defensive investor
and described on p. 90, is about the best specific or automatic for-
mula we can recommend to all investors under the conditions of
1972. But we have retained a broad leeway between the 25% mini-

approaching) bankruptcy, its common stock becomes essentially worthless,
since U.S. bankruptcy law entitles bondholders to a much stronger legal
claim than shareholders. But if the company reorganizes successfully and
comes out of bankruptcy, the bondholders often receive stock in the new
firm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is able
to pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can perform
almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company. In these special
situations, as Graham puts it, "no true distinction exists between bonds and
common stocks."
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  157

mum and the 75% maximum in common stocks, which we allow to
those investors who have strong convictions about either the dan-
ger or the attractiveness of the general market level. Some 20 years
ago it was possible to discuss in great detail a number of clear-cut
formulas for varying the percentage held in common stocks, with
confidence that these plans had practical utility.1 The times seem to
have passed such approaches by, and there would be little point in
trying to determine new levels for buying and selling out of the
market patterns since 1949. That is too short a period to furnish any
reliable guide to the future.*

Growth-Stock Approach

   Every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that
will do better than the average over a period of years. A growth
stock may be defined as one that has done this in the past and
is expected to do so in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that
the intelligent investor should concentrate upon the selection of
growth stocks. Actually the matter is more complicated, as we shall
try to show.

   It is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have "out-
performed the averages" in the past. The investor can obtain a list of
50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker. Why, then, should he
not merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this
group and lo! he has a guaranteed-successful stock portfolio?

* Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he con-
tends that the period since 1949--a stretch of more than 22 years--is too
short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his mastery of
mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very
long samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who peddle "time-
tested" stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their findings on smaller
samples than Graham would ever accept. (Graham often used 50-year peri-
ods to analyze past data.)
 Today, the enterprising investor can assemble such a list over the Internet
by visiting such websites as www.morningstar.com (try the Stock Quickrank
tool), www.quicken.com/investments/stocks/search/full, and http://yahoo.
marketguide.com.
158  The Intelligent Investor

   There are two catches to this simple idea. The first is that com-
mon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell
at correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his
judgment of their prospects and still not fare particularly well,
merely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the
expected prosperity. The second is that his judgment as to the
future may prove wrong. Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up
forever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expan-
sion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement
more difficult. At some point the growth curve flattens out, and in
many cases it turns downward.

   It is obvious that if one confines himself to a few chosen
instances, based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes
can readily be either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How
can one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here? We think
that reasonably sound conclusions can be drawn from a study of
the results achieved by the investment funds specializing in the
growth-stock approach. The authoritative manual entitled Invest-
ment Companies, published annually by Arthur Wiesenberger &
Company, members of the New York Stock Exchange, computes
the annual performance of some 120 such "growth funds" over a
period of years. Of these, 45 have records covering ten years or
more. The average overall gain for these companies--unweighted
for size of fund--works out at 108% for the decade 1961­1970,
compared with 105% for the S & P composite and 83% for the
DJIA.3 In the two years 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126
"growth funds" did worse than either index. Similar results were
found in our earlier studies. The implication here is that no out-
standing rewards came from diversified investment in growth
companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.*

* Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in large
growth companies--today's equivalent of what Graham calls "growth
funds"--earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall
stock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,
"large value" funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies also
underperformed the market over the same period (by a full percentage point
per year). Is the problem merely that growth funds cannot reliably select
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  159

   There is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent
investor, even with much devoted effort, can derive better results
over the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the invest-
ment companies specializing in this area. Surely these organiza-
tions have more brains and better research facilities at their
disposal than you do. Consequently we should advise against the
usual type of growth-stock commitment for the enterprising
investor.* This is one in which the excellent prospects are fully rec-
ognized in the market and already reflected in a current price-
earnings ratio of, say, higher than 20. (For the defensive investor
we suggested an upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average
earnings of the past seven years. The two criteria would be about
equivalent in most cases.)

stocks that will outperform the market in the future? Or is it that the high
costs of running the average fund (whether it buys growth or "value" compa-
nies) exceed any extra return the managers can earn with their stock picks?
To update fund performance by type, see www.morningstar.com, "Category
Returns." For an enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of
different investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_
table/pertable.pdf.
* Graham makes this point to remind you that an "enterprising" investor is
not one who takes more risk than average or who buys "aggressive growth"
stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who is willing to put in extra
time and effort in researching his or her portfolio.
 Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio based
on a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the odds that
you will overestimate a company's value based on a temporarily high burst
of profitability. Imagine that a company earned $3 per share over the past
12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six
years. Which number--the sudden $3 or the steady 50 cents--is more likely
to represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the $3 it earned in the most
recent year, the stock would be priced at $75. But at 25 times the average
earnings of the past seven years ($6 in total earnings, divided by seven,
equals 85.7 cents per share in average annual earnings), the stock would
be priced at only $21.43. Which number you pick makes a big difference.
Finally, it's worth noting that the prevailing method on Wall Street today--
basing price/earnings ratios primarily on "next year's earnings"--would be
160  The Intelligent Investor

   The striking thing about growth stocks as a class is their ten-
dency toward wide swings in market price. This is true of the
largest and longest-established companies--such as General Elec-
tric and International Business Machines--and even more so of
newer and smaller successful companies. They illustrate our thesis
that the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been
the injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com-
panies which have scored the most brilliant successes, and which
themselves would be entitled to a high investment rating. (Their
credit standing is of the best, and they pay the lowest interest rates
on their borrowings.) The investment caliber of such a company
may not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteris-
tics of its stock will depend on what happens to it in the stock mar-
ket. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and the faster
its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the
riskier a proposition it becomes.*

   But is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes
from common stocks have been garnered by those who made a
substantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose
future they had great confidence, and who held their original
shares unwaveringly while they increased 100-fold or more in
value? The answer is "Yes." But the big fortunes from single-
company investments are almost always realized by persons who

anathema to Graham. How can you value a company based on earnings it
hasn't even generated yet? That's like setting house prices based on a
rumor that Cinderella will be building her new castle right around the corner.
* Recent examples hammer Graham's point home. On September 21,
2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it expected
its revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first blush, that
sounds great; most big companies would be delighted to increase their
sales by 5% in just three months. But in response, Intel's stock dropped
22%, a one-day loss of nearly $91 billion in total value. Why? Wall Street's
analysts had expected Intel's revenue to rise by up to 10%. Similarly, on
February 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage firm, announced that it
expected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in 2001--but that a new cau-
tion among customers "may lead to longer selling cycles." On that whiff of
hesitation, EMC's shares lost 12.8% of their value in a single day.

have a close relationship with the particular company--through
employment, family connection, etc.--which justifies them in plac-
ing a large part of their resources in one medium and holding on
to this commitment through all vicissitudes, despite numerous
temptations to sell out at apparently high prices along the way.
An investor without such close personal contact will constantly
be faced with the question of whether too large a portion of
his funds are in this one medium.* Each decline--however tempo-
rary it proves in the sequel--will accentuate his problem; and
internal and external pressures are likely to force him to take what
seems to be a goodly profit, but one far less than the ultimate
bonanza.4

Three Recommended Fields for "Enterprising Investment"

   To obtain better than average investment results over a long pull
requires a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold
merit: (1) It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying
soundness; and (2) it must be different from the policy followed by
most investors or speculators. Our experience and study leads us
to recommend three investment approaches that meet these crite-
ria. They differ rather widely from one another, and each may
require a different type of knowledge and temperament on the part
of those who assay it.

* Today's equivalent of investors "who have a close relationship with the par-
ticular company" are so-called control persons--senior managers or direc-
tors who help run the company and own huge blocks of stock. Executives
like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway have
direct control over a company's destiny--and outside investors want to see
these chief executives maintain their large shareholdings as a vote of confi-
dence. But less-senior managers and rank-and-file workers cannot influence
the company's share price with their individual decisions; thus they should
not put more than a small percentage of their assets in their own employer's
stock. As for outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the
company, the same objection applies.

The Relatively Unpopular Large Company

   If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com-
mon stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are
glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will
undervalue--relatively, at least--companies that are out of favor
because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.
This may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market,
and it suggests an investment approach that should prove both
conservative and promising.

   The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor
concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a
period of unpopularity. While small companies may also be
undervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may later
increase their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of a
definitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by
the market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thus
have a double advantage over the others. First, they have the
resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-
sity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is
likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement
shown.

   A remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is
found in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an
investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues
in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their
current or previous year's earnings. These could be called the
"cheapest" stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the
reflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was
assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of
holding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these
investments were then compared with the results shown in either
the DJIA as a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-
ular) group.

   The detailed material we have available covers the results of
annual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5 In the early
period, 1917­1933, this approach proved unprofitable. But since
1933 the method has shown highly successful results. In 34 tests

made by Drexel & Company (now Drexel Firestone)* of one-year
holding--from 1937 through 1969--the cheap stocks did definitely
worse than the DJIA in only three instances; the results were about
the same in six cases; and the cheap stocks clearly outperformed
the average in 25 years. The consistently better performance of the
low-multiplier stocks is shown (Table 7-2) by the average results
for successive five-year periods, when compared with those of the
DJIA and of the ten high-multipliers.

   The Drexel computation shows further that an original invest-
ment of $10,000 made in the low-multiplier issues in 1936, and
switched each year in accordance with the principle, would have
grown to $66,900 by 1962. The same operations in high-multiplier
stocks would have ended with a value of only $25,300; while an
operation in all thirty stocks would have increased the original
fund to $44,000.

execution on a group basis, as described above, are both quite sim-
ple. But in considering individual companies a special factor of
opposite import must sometimes to be taken into account. Compa-
nies that are inherently speculative because of widely varying
earnings tend to sell both at a relatively high price and at a rela-
tively low multiplier in their good years, and conversely at low
prices and high multipliers in their bad years. These relationships
are illustrated in Table 7-3, covering fluctuations of Chrysler Corp.
common. In these cases the market has sufficient skepticism as to
the continuation of the unusually high profits to value them con-
servatively, and conversely when earnings are low or nonexistent.
(Note that, by the arithmetic, if a company earns "next to nothing"
its shares must sell at a high multiplier of these minuscule profits.)

   As it happens Chrysler has been quite exceptional in the DJIA
list of leading companies, and hence it did not greatly affect the the
low-multiplier calculations. It would be quite easy to avoid inclu-
sion of such anomalous issues in a low-multiplier list by requiring
also that the price be low in relation to past average earnings or by
some similar test.

   While writing this revision we tested the results of the DJIA-
low-multiplier method applied to a group assumed to be bought at

the end of 1968 and revalued on June 30, 1971. This time the figures
proved quite disappointing, showing a sharp loss for the low-
multiplier six or ten and a good profit for the high-multiplier selec-
tions. This one bad instance should not vitiate conclusions based
on 30-odd experiments, but its recent happening gives it a special
adverse weight. Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with
the "low-multiplier" idea, but add other quantitative and qualita-
tive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.

Purchase of Bargain Issues

   We define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts
established by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more
than it is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks
selling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete
as possible, let us suggest that an issue is not a true "bargain"
unless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What
kind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-
ancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does
the investor profit from them?

   There are two tests by which a bargain common stock is
detected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely
on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-
tor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-
ciently above the market price--and if the investor has confidence
in the technique employed--he can tag the stock as a bargain. The
second test is the value of the business to a private owner. This
value also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-
ings--in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in
the second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable
value of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current
assets or working capital.

   At low points in the general market a large proportion of com-
mon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A
typical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in
1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning
in excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.) It is true
that current earnings and the immediate prospects may both be
poor, but a levelheaded appraisal of average future conditions
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  167

would indicate values far above ruling prices. Thus the wisdom of
having courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the
voice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques
of value analysis.

   The same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish
a bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of
many individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is
fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-
nary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest
or enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.
Thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-
tion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect
or unpopularity.

   However, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,
can be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.
How can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are
indeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent
examples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous
for their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire
them at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in
boom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by
Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.

   If this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating
earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy
matter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in

* Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of molehills:
In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
announced that six men taking Pfizer's anti-impotence drug Viagra had died
of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer's stock immediately went flaccid,
losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading. But Pfizer's shares surged
ahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the
stock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997, shares of
Warner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a day when sales of its new diabetes
drug were temporarily halted in England; within six months, the stock had
nearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,
lost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea
and vomiting--on ships run by other companies.
168  The Intelligent Investor

earnings and price which were not followed automatically by a
handsome recovery of both. One such was Anaconda Wire and
Cable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85
in that year. The earnings then declined irregularly for six years;
the price fell to 231/2 in 1962, and the following year it was taken
over by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equiv-
alent of only 33.

   The many experiences of this type suggest that the investor
would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price
to give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indi-
cation of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past
decade or more--i.e., no year of earnings deficit--plus sufficient
size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.
The ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent
company selling both well below its past average price and its past
average price/earnings multiplier. This would no doubt have
ruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as
Chrysler, since their low-price years are generally accompanied by
high price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader now--and
no doubt we shall do it again--that there is a world of difference
between "hindsight profits" and "real-money profits." We doubt
seriously whether the Chrysler type of roller coaster is a suitable
medium for operations by our enterprising investor.

   We have mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec-
ond cause of price declines to unduly low levels. A current case of
this kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull
market of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the
$5.61 earnings for that year. The per-share profits increased in both
1969 and 1970, but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was
less than 4 times the (record) earnings in that year and less than its
net-current-asset value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only
51/2 times the last reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-
current-asset value.

   Another example of this type is provided currently by Standard
Oil of California, a concern of major importance. In early 1972 it
was selling at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its
earnings had been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth
but with only one small decline over the entire period. Its book
value was about equal to the market price. With this conservatively
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  169

favorable 1958­71 record the company has never shown an aver-
age annual price as high as 15 times its current earnings. In early
1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about 10.

   A third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may
be the market's failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our
classic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946­47
declined from 36 to 131/2. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were
close to $10 per share. The price of the stock was held down in
great part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of
its earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar
to railroads.

   The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a
common stock that sells for less than the company's net working
capital alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would
mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets--
buildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.
Very few companies turn out to have an ultimate value less than
the working capital alone, although scattered instances may be
found. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many
enterprises obtainable which have been valued in the market on
this bargain basis. A compilation made in 1957, when the market's
level was by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common
stocks. In Table 7-4 we summarize the result of buying, on Decem-
ber 31, 1957, one share of each of the 85 companies in that list for
which data appeared in Standard & Poor's Monthly Stock Guide,
and holding them for two years.

   By something of a coincidence, each of the groups advanced in
the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate
net-current-asset value. The gain for the entire "portfolio" in that
period was 75%, against 50% for Standard & Poor's 425 industrials.
What is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed signifi-
cant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable
gains.

   Our experience with this type of investment selection--on a

diversified basis--was uniformly good for many years prior to
1957. It can probably be affirmed without hesitation that it consti-
tutes a safe and profitable method of determining and taking
advantage of undervalued situations. However, during the general
market advance after 1957 the number of such opportunities
became extremely limited, and many of those available were show-
ing small operating profits or even losses. The market decline of
1969­70 produced a new crop of these "sub-working-capital"
stocks. We discuss this group in Chapter 15, on stock selection for
the enterprising investor.

   Bargain-Issue Pattern in Secondary Companies. We have
defined a secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly
important industry. Thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns
in its field, but it may equally well be the chief unit in an unimpor-
tant line. By way of exception, any company that has established
itself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered "secondary."

   In the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction
was drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues, pro-
vided the latter were of respectable size. The public felt that a
middle-sized company was strong enough to weather storms and
that it had a better chance for really spectacular expansion than one
that was already of major dimensions. The depression years
1931­32, however, had a particularly devastating impact on the
companies below the first rank either in size or in inherent stability.
As a result of that experience investors have since developed a pro-
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  171

nounced preference for industry leaders and a corresponding lack
of interest most of the time in the ordinary company of secondary
importance. This has meant that the latter group have usually sold
at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have
the former. It has meant further that in many instances the price
has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.

   When investors rejected the stocks of secondary companies,
even though these sold at relatively low prices, they were express-
ing a belief or fear that such companies faced a dismal future. In
fact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that any price was too
high for them because they were heading for extinction--just as in
1929 the companion theory for the "blue chips" was that no price
was too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-
less. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive
of serious investment errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized
listed company is a large one when compared with the average pri-
vately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-
nies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the
vicissitudes characteristic of our economy but earning on the
whole a fair return on their invested capital.

   This brief review indicates that the stock market's attitude
toward secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and conse-
quently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major
undervaluation. As it happens, the World War II period and the
postwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to
the larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was
suspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins
more spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the market's pattern had com-
pletely reversed itself from that before the war. Whereas the lead-
ing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only
40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard & Poor's index
of low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the same
period. Speculators and many self-styled investors--with the
proverbial short memories of people in the stock market--were
eager to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at
inflated levels. Thus the pendulum had swung clear to the oppo-
site extreme. The very class of secondary issues that had formerly
supplied by far the largest proportion of bargain opportunities was
now presenting the greatest number of examples of overenthusi-
172  The Intelligent Investor

asm and overvaluation. In a different way this phenomenon was
repeated in 1961 and 1968--the emphasis now being placed on
new offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-
ary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields
such as "electronics," "computers," "franchise" concerns, and oth-
ers.*

   As was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most
heavily on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum
swing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.

   If most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what
reason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-
uation? For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the
same market position as when he bought the issue? The answer
here is somewhat complicated. Substantial profits from the pur-
chase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of
ways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-
vested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will
ultimately affect the price. In a five- to seven-year period these
advantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull
market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it
tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.
Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-
uous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary
issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level
for their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many

* From 1975 through 1983, small ("secondary") stocks outperformed large
stocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year. The
investing public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund companies
rolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and small stocks
obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage points per year
over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when small stocks beat
big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring investment bankers to
sell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to the public for the first time.
Instead of "electronics," "computers," or "franchise" in their names, the new
buzzwords were ".com," "optical," "wireless," and even prefixes like "e-" and
"I-." Investing buzzwords always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone
who believes in them.

cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be cor-
rected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new
policies, or by a change in management.

   An important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition
of smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversifi-
cation program. In these cases the consideration paid has almost
always been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain
levels existing not long before.

   When interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of
bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at
large discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have
a different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large
discounts if carrying coupon rates of, say, 41/2% or less. Example:
American Telephone & Telegraph 25/8s, due 1986, sold as low as 51
in 1970; Deere & Co. 41/2s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may
well turn out to have been bargain opportunities before very
long--if ruling interest rates should decline substantially. For a
bargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall
have to turn once more to the first-mortgage bonds of railroads
now in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-
tions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values
in this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-
dency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently
the group as a whole offers an especially rewarding invitation to
careful and courageous analysis. In the decade ending in 1948 the
billion-dollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer-
ous and spectacular opportunities in this area. Such opportunities
have been quite scarce since then; but they seem likely to return in
the 1970s.*

* Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today. How-
ever, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds, as well as con-
vertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer real value in the
wake of the 2000­2002 market crash. But diversification in this area is
essential--and impractical without at least $100,000 to dedicate to dis-
tressed securities alone. Unless you are a millionaire several times over, this
kind of diversification is not an option.
174  The Intelligent Investor

Special Situations, or "Workouts"

   Not so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee
an attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in
it; and this was true under almost any sort of general market situa-
tion. It was not actually forbidden territory to members of the gen-
eral public. Some who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn
the ropes and become pretty capable practitioners without the
necessity of long academic study or apprenticeship. Others have
been keen enough to recognize the underlying soundness of this
approach and to attach themselves to bright young men who
handled funds devoted chiefly to these "special situations." But
in recent years, for reasons we shall develop later, the field of "arbi-
trages and workouts" became riskier and less profitable. It may
be that in years to come conditions in this field will become more
propitious. In any case it is worthwhile outlining the general
nature and origin of these operations, with one or two illustrative
examples.

   The typical "special situation" has grown out of the increasing
number of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones, as the gospel
of diversification of products has been adopted by more and more
managements. It often appears good business for such an enter-
prise to acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter
rather than to start a new venture from scratch. In order to make
such acquisition possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by
the required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company,
it is almost always necessary to offer a price considerably above
the current level. Such corporate moves have been producing inter-
esting profit-making opportunities for those who have made a
study of this field, and have good judgment fortified by ample
experience.

   A great deal of money was made by shrewd investors not so
many years ago through the purchase of bonds of railroads in
bankruptcy--bonds which they knew would be worth much more
than their cost when the railroads were finally reorganized. After
promulgation of the plans of reorganization a "when issued" mar-
ket for the new securities appeared. These could almost always be
sold for considerably more than the cost of the old issues which
were to be exchanged therefor. There were risks of nonconsumma-
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  175

tion of the plans or of unexpected delays, but on the whole such
"arbitrage operations" proved highly profitable.

   There were similar opportunities growing out of the breakup of
public-utility holding companies pursuant to 1935 legislation.
Nearly all these enterprises proved to be worth considerably more
when changed from holding companies to a group of separate
operating companies.

   The underlying factor here is the tendency of the security mar-
kets to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of compli-
cated legal proceedings. An old Wall Street motto has been: "Never
buy into a lawsuit." This may be sound advice to the speculator
seeking quick action on his holdings. But the adoption of this atti-
tude by the general public is bound to create bargain opportunities
in the securities affected by it, since the prejudice against them
holds their prices down to unduly low levels.*

   The exploitation of special situations is a technical branch of
investment which requires a somewhat unusual mentality and
equipment. Probably only a small percentage of our enterprising
investors are likely to engage in it, and this book is not the appro-
priate medium for expounding its complications.6

Broader Implications of Our Rules for Investment

   Investment policy, as it has been developed here, depends in the
first place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive (pas-
sive) or aggressive (enterprising) role. The aggressive investor
must have a considerable knowledge of security values--enough,
in fact, to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to
a business enterprise. There is no room in this philosophy for a

* A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23% in two
days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive damages of
up to $200 billion against the company--which had finally admitted that cig-
arettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip Morris's stock had doubled--
only to fall back after a later multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several
other stocks have been virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including
Johns Manville, W. R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, "never buy into a law-
suit" remains a valid rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.
176  The Intelligent Investor

middle ground, or a series of gradations, between the passive and
aggressive status. Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place
themselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is
a compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than
achievement.

   As an investor you cannot soundly become "half a business-
man," expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business
profits on your funds.

   It follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own-
ers should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the
time, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark
upon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-
fied with the excellent return now obtainable from a defensive
portfolio (and with even less), and they should stoutly resist the
recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other
paths.

   The enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-
rity operation for which his training and judgment are adequate
and which appears sufficiently promising when measured by estab-
lished business standards.

   In our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors
we have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for
the defensive investor we have been guided largely by the three
requirements of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and prom-
ise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology as well as arith-
metic. The use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field
of recommended investment a number of security classes that are
normally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors. These
prohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p. 30.

   Let us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in
these exclusions. We have advised against the purchase at "full
prices" of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign
bonds, (2) ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common
stocks, including, of course, original offerings of such issues. By
"full prices" we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferred
stocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value of
the enterprise in the case of common stocks. The greater number
of defensive investors are to avoid these categories regardless of
price; the enterprising investor is to buy them only when obtain-
Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side  177

able at bargain prices--which we define as prices not more than
two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities.

   What would happen if all investors were guided by our advice
in these matters? That question was considered in regard to for-
eign bonds, on p. 138, and we have nothing to add at this point.
Investment-grade preferred stocks would be bought solely by cor-
porations, such as insurance companies, which would benefit from
the special income-tax status of stock issues owned by them.

   The most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is
in the field of secondary common stocks. If the majority of
investors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all,
the field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted. Further-
more, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,
then these issues would be doomed to sell for less than their fair
value, except to the extent that they were purchased unintelli-
gently.

   This may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth
we are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area
for the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the
most part, do fluctuate about a central level which is well below
their fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;
but this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-
sons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of
paying the prevailing prices for common stocks.

   Thus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-
nize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they
accept the central market levels that are normal for that class as
their guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.

   There is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected
secondary company may be fully as promising as the average
industrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-
ity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-
sequently it may appear illogical to many readers to term
"unintelligent" the purchase of such secondary issues at their full
"enterprise value." We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-
rience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect
satisfactory results, on the average, from secondary common
stocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a private
owner, that is, on a bargain basis.
178  The Intelligent Investor

   The last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi-
nary outside investor. Anyone who can control a secondary com-
pany, or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully
justified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest-
ing in a "close corporation" or other private business. The distinc-
tion between the position, and consequent investment policy, of
insiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise
itself becomes less important. It is a basic characteristic of a primary
or leading company that a single detached share is ordinarily
worth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary com-
panies the average market value of a detached share is substantially
less than its worth to a controlling owner. Because of this fact, the
matter of shareholder-management relations and of those between
inside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important
and controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary
companies.

   At the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak-
ing any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary
companies. The many common stocks in the boundary area may
properly exhibit an intermediate price behavior. It would not be
illogical for an investor to buy such an issue at a small discount
from its indicated or appraisal value, on the theory that it is only a
small distance away from a primary classification and that it may
acquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.

   Thus the distinction between primary and secondary issues
need not be made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference
in quality must produce a large differential in justified purchase
price. In saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas-
sification of common stocks, although we counseled against such a
middle ground in the classification of investors. Our reason for this
apparent inconsistency is as follows: No great harm comes from
some uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security, because
such cases are exceptional and not a great deal is at stake in the
matter. But the investor's choice as between the defensive or the
aggressive status is of major consequence to him, and he should
not allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci-
sion.

TIMING IS NOTHING
In an ideal world, the intelligent investor would hold stocks only when
they are cheap and sell them when they become overpriced, then
duck into the bunker of bonds and cash until stocks again become
cheap enough to buy. From 1966 through late 2001, one study
claimed, $1 held continuously in stocks would have grown to $11.71.
But if you had gotten out of stocks right before the five worst days of
each year, your original $1 would have grown to $987.12.1

   Like most magical market ideas, this one is based on sleight of
hand. How, exactly, would you (or anyone) figure out which days will
be the worst days--before they arrive? On January 7, 1973, the New
York Times featured an interview with one of the nation's top financial
forecasters, who urged investors to buy stocks without hesitation: "It's
very rare that you can be as unqualifiedly bullish as you can now." That
forecaster was named Alan Greenspan, and it's very rare that anyone

of this article is a useful reminder of an enduring principle for the intelligent in-

yourself; many of the quotes that follow are likely to be lies. (For one thing, an

have ended up with at least $40, not $11.71; the study cited in Barron's ap-

has ever been so unqualifiedly wrong as the future Federal Reserve
chairman was that day: 1973 and 1974 turned out to be the worst
years for economic growth and the stock market since the Great
Depression.2

   Can professionals time the market any better than Alan Green-
span? "I see no reason not to think the majority of the decline is
behind us," declared Kate Leary Lee, president of the market-timing
firm of R. M. Leary & Co., on December 3, 2001. "This is when you
want to be in the market," she added, predicting that stocks "look
good" for the first quarter of 2002.3 Over the next three months,
stocks earned a measly 0.28% return, underperforming cash by 1.5
percentage points.

   Leary is not alone. A study by two finance professors at Duke Univer-
sity found that if you had followed the recommendations of the best 10%
of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annual-
ized return from 1991 through 1995. But if you had ignored them and
kept your money in a stock index fund, you would have earned 16.4%.4

   As the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard noted, life can only
be understood backwards--but it must be lived forwards. Looking
back, you can always see exactly when you should have bought and
sold your stocks. But don't let that fool you into thinking you can see,
in real time, just when to get in and out. In the financial markets, hind-
sight is forever 20/20, but foresight is legally blind. And thus, for most
investors, market timing is a practical and emotional impossibility.5

WHAT G OE S U P . . .

Like spacecraft that pick up speed as they rise into the Earth's strato-
sphere, growth stocks often seem to defy gravity. Let's look at the tra-
jectories of three of the hottest growth stocks of the 1990s: General
Electric, Home Depot, and Sun Microsystems. (See Figure 7-1.)

   In every year from 1995 through 1999, each grew bigger and more
profitable. Revenues doubled at Sun and more than doubled at Home
Depot. According to Value Line, GE's revenues grew 29%; its earnings
rose 65%. At Home Depot and Sun, earnings per share roughly tripled.

   But something else was happening--and it wouldn't have surprised
Graham one bit. The faster these companies grew, the more expen-
sive their stocks became. And when stocks grow faster than compa-
nies, investors always end up sorry. As Figure 7-2 shows:

   A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for
the stock.

   The more a stock has gone up, the more it seems likely to keep going
up. But that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental law
of financial physics: The bigger they get, the slower they grow. A $1-
billion company can double its sales fairly easily; but where can a $50-
billion company turn to find another $50 billion in business?

   Growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable,
but when their price/earnings ratios go much above 25 or 30 the odds
get ugly:

· Journalist Carol Loomis found that, from 1960 through 1999, only
     eight of the largest 150 companies on the Fortune 500 list man-
     aged to raise their earnings by an annual average of at least 15%
     for two decades.6

· Looking at five decades of data, the research firm of Sanford C.
     Bernstein & Co. showed that only 10% of large U.S. companies
     had increased their earnings by 20% for at least five consecutive
     years; only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 years straight;
     and not a single one had done it for 15 years in a row.7

· An academic study of thousands of U.S. stocks from 1951
     through 1998 found that over all 10-year periods, net earnings
     grew by an average of 9.7% annually. But for the biggest 20% of
     companies, earnings grew by an annual average of just 9.3%.8

   Even many corporate leaders fail to understand these odds (see side-
bar on p. 184). The intelligent investor, however, gets interested in big
growth stocks not when they are at their most popular--but when some-
thing goes wrong. In July 2002, Johnson & Johnson announced that
Federal regulators were investigating accusations of false record keep-
ing at one of its drug factories, and the stock lost 16% in a single day.
That took J & J's share price down from 24 times the previous 12 months'
earnings to just 20 times. At that lower level, Johnson & Johnson might
once again have become a growth stock with room to grow--making it an
example of what Graham calls "the relatively unpopular large company." 9
This kind of temporary unpopularity can create lasting wealth by enabling
you to buy a great company at a good price.

                       HIGH POTENTIAL
                  FOR HYPE POTENTIAL

Investors aren't the only people who fall prey to the delusion that
hyper-growth can go on forever. In February 2000, chief execu-
tive John Roth of Nortel Networks was asked how much bigger
his giant fiber-optics company could get. "The industry is grow-
ing 14% to 15% a year," Roth replied, "and we're going to grow
six points faster than that. For a company our size, that's pretty
heady stuff." Nortel's stock, up nearly 51% annually over the pre-
vious six years, was then trading at 87 times what Wall Street
was guessing it might earn in 2000. Was the stock overpriced?
"It's getting up there," shrugged Roth, "but there's still plenty of
room to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless strat-
egy." (After all, he added, Cisco Systems was trading at 121
times its projected earnings!)1

   As for Cisco, in November 2000, its chief executive, John
Chambers, insisted that his company could keep growing at
least 50% annually. "Logic," he declared, "would indicate this is
a breakaway." Cisco's stock had come way down--it was then
trading at a mere 98 times its earnings over the previous year--
and Chambers urged investors to buy. "So who you going to bet
on?" he asked. "Now may be the opportunity." 2

   Instead, these growth companies shrank--and their over-
priced stocks shriveled. Nortel's revenues fell by 37% in 2001,
and the company lost more than $26 billion that year. Cisco's
revenues did rise by 18% in 2001, but the company ended up
with a net loss of more than $1 billion. Nortel's stock, at
$113.50 when Roth spoke, finished 2002 at $1.65. Cisco's
shares, at $52 when Chambers called his company a "break-
away," crumbled to $13.

   Both companies have since become more circumspect
about forecasting the future.

"Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket," pro-

ham points out, "the really big fortunes from common stocks" have
been made by people who packed all their money into one investment
they knew supremely well.

   Nearly all the richest people in America trace their wealth to a con-
centrated investment in a single industry or even a single company
(think Bill Gates and Microsoft, Sam Walton and Wal-Mart, or the
Rockefellers and Standard Oil). The Forbes 400 list of the richest
Americans, for example, has been dominated by undiversified fortunes
ever since it was first compiled in 1982.

   However, almost no small fortunes have been made this way--and
not many big fortunes have been kept this way. What Carnegie neg-
lected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great
failures of life. Look again at the Forbes "Rich List." Back in 1982, the
average net worth of a Forbes 400 member was $230 million. To
make it onto the 2002 Forbes 400, the average 1982 member
needed to earn only a 4.5% average annual return on his wealth--
during a period when even bank accounts yielded far more than that
and the stock market gained an annual average of 13.2%.

   So how many of the Forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on
the list 20 years later? Only 64 of the original members--a measly
16%--were still on the list in 2002. By keeping all their eggs in the one
basket that had gotten them onto the list in the first place--once-
booming industries like oil and gas, or computer hardware, or basic
manufacturing--all the other original members fell away. When hard
times hit, none of these people--despite all the huge advantages that
great wealth can bring--were properly prepared. They could only
stand by and wince at the sickening crunch as the constantly chang-
ing economy crushed their only basket and all their eggs.10

400, I am indebted to investment manager Kenneth Fisher (himself a Forbes
columnist).

THE BARGAIN BIN

You might think that in our endlessly networked world, it would be a
cinch to build and buy a list of stocks that meet Graham's criteria for
bargains (p. 169). Although the Internet is a help, you'll still have to do
much of the work by hand.

   Grab a copy of today's Wall Street Journal, turn to the "Money &
Investing" section, and take a look at the NYSE and NASDAQ Score-
cards to find the day's lists of stocks that have hit new lows for the
past year--a quick and easy way to search for companies that might
pass Graham's net-working-capital tests. (Online, try http://quote.
morningstar.com/highlow.html?msection=HighLow.)

   To see whether a stock is selling for less than the value of net work-
ing capital (what Graham's followers call "net nets"), download or
request the most recent quarterly or annual report from the company's
website or from the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. From the
company's current assets, subtract its total liabilities, including any
preferred stock and long-term debt. (Or consult your local public
library's copy of the Value Line Investment Survey, saving yourself a
costly annual subscription. Each issue carries a list of "Bargain Base-
ment Stocks" that come close to Graham's definition.) Most of these
stocks lately have been in bombed-out areas like high-tech and
telecommunications.

   As of October 31, 2002, for instance, Comverse Technology had
$2.4 billion in current assets and $1.0 billion in total liabilities, giving it
$1.4 billion in net working capital. With fewer than 190 million shares
of stock, and a stock price under $8 per share, Comverse had a total
market capitalization of just under $1.4 billion. With the stock priced
at no more than the value of Comverse's cash and inventories, the
company's ongoing business was essentially selling for nothing. As
Graham knew, you can still lose money on a stock like Comverse--
which is why you should buy them only if you can find a couple dozen
at a time and hold them patiently. But on the very rare occasions when
Mr. Market generates that many true bargains, you're all but certain to
make money.

WHAT'S YOU R F OR E I G N P OLI CY?

Investing in foreign stocks may not be mandatory for the intelligent
investor, but it is definitely advisable. Why? Let's try a little thought
Commentary on Chapter 7  187

experiment. It's the end of 1989, and you're Japanese. Here are the
facts:

· Over the past 10 years, your stock market has gained an annual
     average of 21.2%, well ahead of the 17.5% annual gains in the
     United States.

· Japanese companies are buying up everything in the United
     States from the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center;
     meanwhile, American firms like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Finan-
     cial Corp. of America, and Texaco are going bankrupt.

· The U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan's is booming.

   In 1989, in the land of the rising sun, you can only conclude that
investing outside of Japan is the dumbest idea since sushi vending
machines. Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks.

   The result? Over the next decade, you lose roughly two-thirds of
your money.

   The lesson? It's not that you should never invest in foreign markets
like Japan; it's that the Japanese should never have kept all their
money at home. And neither should you. If you live in the United
States, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are
already making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent,
you should put some of your investment portfolio elsewhere--simply
because no one, anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at
home or abroad. Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual
funds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets)
helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be
the best place in the world to invest.
CHAPTER 8

The Investor and Market Fluctuations

To the extent that the investor's funds are placed in high-grade

bonds of relatively short maturity--say, of seven years or less--he
will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and
need not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdings
of U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price
or more.) His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price
swings during their lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio is
almost certain to fluctuate in value over any period of several
years.

   The investor should know about these possibilities and should
be prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will
want to benefit from changes in market levels--certainly through
an advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, and
perhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous
prices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate
enough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead him
into speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you
not to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this
advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want to
speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-
bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program.

   We shall deal first with the more important subject of price
changes in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds.
In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market's
action over the past hundred years. In this section we shall return
to that material from time to time, in order to see what the past
record promises the investor--in either the form of long-term
appreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through

188
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  189

successive rises and declines, or in the possibilities of buying
near bear-market lows and selling not too far below bull-market
highs.

Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions

   Since common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to
recurrent and wide fluctuations in their prices, the intelligent
investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from
these pendulum swings. There are two possible ways by which
he may try to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing.
By timing we mean the endeavor to anticipate the action of the
stock market--to buy or hold when the future course is deemed
to be upward, to sell or refrain from buying when the course
is downward. By pricing we mean the endeavor to buy stocks
when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when
they rise above such value. A less ambitious form of pricing is
the simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not
pay too much for your stocks. This may suffice for the defen-
sive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as
such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market
levels.1

   We are convinced that the intelligent investor can derive satis-
factory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure that
if he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting, he
will end up as a speculator and with a speculator's financial
results. This distinction may seem rather tenuous to the layman,
and it is not commonly accepted on Wall Street. As a matter of
business practice, or perhaps of thoroughgoing conviction, the
stock brokers and the investment services seem wedded to the
principle that both investors and speculators in common stocks
should devote careful attention to market forecasts.

   The farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one
will find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecast-
ing or timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer-
able predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the
asking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts
upon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is impor-
tant for him to form some opinion of the future course of the stock
190  The Intelligent Investor

market, and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast
is at least more dependable than his own.*

   We lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of mar-
ket forecasting. A great deal of brain power goes into this field, and
undoubtedly some people can make money by being good stock-
market analysts. But it is absurd to think that the general public can
ever make money out of market forecasts. For who will buy when
the general public, at a given signal, rushes to sell out at a profit? If
you, the reader, expect to get rich over the years by following some
system or leadership in market forecasting, you must be expecting
to try to do what countless others are aiming at, and to be able to
do it better than your numerous competitors in the market. There
is no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any
typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more
successfully than the general public, of which he is himself a part.

   There is one aspect of the "timing" philosophy which seems to
have escaped everyone's notice. Timing is of great psychological
importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in

* In the late 1990s, the forecasts of "market strategists" became more influ-
ential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become more accurate.
On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite index hit its
all-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities's chief technical analyst
Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected NASDAQ to hit 6000
within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to
3321.29--but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, declared that "there's only 200 or 300 points of downside for the
NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside." It turned out that there were no points
on the upside and more than 2000 on the downside, as NASDAQ kept
crashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In
March 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman,
Sachs & Co., predicted that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would
close the year at 1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would
finish 2001 at 13,000. "We do not expect a recession," said Cohen, "and
believe that corporate profits are likely to grow at close to trend growth
rates later this year." The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as
she spoke, and the S & P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the Dow fin-
ished at 10,021.50--30% and 23% below her forecasts, respectively.
             The Investor and Market Fluctuations  191

a hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is
repugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no conse-
quence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having
his money uninvested until he receives some (presumably) trust-
worthy signal that the time has come to buy? He enjoys an advan-
tage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently
lower price to offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is
that timing is of no real value to the investor unless it coincides
with pricing--that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares
at substantially under his previous selling price.

   In this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and
sales has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its
signal to buy from a special kind of "breakthrough" of the stock
averages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-
through on the down side. The calculated--not necessarily
actual--results of using this method showed an almost unbroken
series of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s. On the
basis of this presentation the practical value of the Dow theory
would have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if any, would
apply to the dependability of this published "record" as a picture
of what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the market.

   A closer study of the figures indicates that the quality of the
results shown by the Dow theory changed radically after 1938--
a few years after the theory had begun to be taken seriously on
Wall Street. Its spectacular achievement had been in giving a sell
signal, at 306, about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping
its followers out of the long bear market until things had pretty
well righted themselves, at 84, in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow
theory operated mainly by taking its practitioners out at a pretty
good price but then putting them back in again at a higher price.
For nearly 30 years thereafter, one would have done appreciably
better by just buying and holding the DJIA.2

   In our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in
the Dow-theory results is not accidental. It demonstrates an inher-
ent characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields
of business and finance. Those formulas that gain adherents and

* See p. 3.
192  The Intelligent Investor

importance do so because they have worked well over a period, or
sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the
statistical record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their
reliability tends to diminish. This happens for two reasons: First,
the passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula
no longer fits. Second, in stock-market affairs the popularity of a
trading theory has itself an influence on the market's behavior
which detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.
(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre-
ate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance or
decline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling
signal is given. A "stampede" of this kind is, of course, much more
of a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)

Buy-Low­Sell-High Approach

   We are convinced that the average investor cannot deal success-
fully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can
he benefit from them after they have taken place--i.e., by buying
after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?
The fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to
1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic
definition of a "shrewd investor" was "one who bought in a bear
market when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar-
ket when everyone else was buying." If we examine our Chart I,
covering the fluctuations of the Standard & Poor's composite index
between 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.
66), we can readily see why this viewpoint appeared valid until
fairly recent years.

   Between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles,
running from bear-market low to bull-market high and back to
bear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, four
ran for six or seven years, and one--the famous "new-era" cycle of
1921­1932--lasted eleven years. The percentage of advance from
the lows to highs ranged from 44% to 500%, with most between
about 50% and 100%. The percentage of subsequent declines
ranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40% and 50%.
(It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a pre-
ceding advance of 100%.)
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  193

   Nearly all the bull markets had a number of well-defined char-
acteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level, (2)
high price/earnings ratios, (3) low dividend yields as against bond
yields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of
new common-stock issues of poor quality. Thus to the student of
stock-market history it appeared that the intelligent investor
should have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar-
kets, to buy in the former and sell in the latter, and to do so for the
most part at reasonably short intervals of time. Various methods
were developed for determining buying and selling levels of the
general market, based on either value factors or percentage move-
ments of prices or both.

   But we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull
market that began in 1949, there were sufficient variations in the
successive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the
desirable process of buying low and selling high. The most notable
of these departures, of course, was the great bull market of the late
1920s, which threw all calculations badly out of gear.* Even in 1949,
therefore, it was by no means a certainty that the investor could
base his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor
to buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in
bull markets.

   It turned out, in the sequel, that the opposite was true. The

* Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone waiting to
"buy low" will feel completely left behind--and, all too often, will end up
abandoning any former caution and jumping in with both feet. That's why
Graham's message about the importance of emotional discipline is so
important. From October 1990 through January 2000, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing more than
20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The total gain
(not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall, Pierce & Co., this
was the second-longest uninterrupted bull market of the past century; only
the 1949­1961 boom lasted longer. The longer a bull market lasts, the
more severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so,
many people no longer believe that bear markets are even possible. All
those who forget are doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market,
recovered memories are always unpleasant.
194  The Intelligent Investor

market's behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former
pattern, nor obeyed what once were well-established danger sig-
nals, nor permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules
for buying low and selling high. Whether the old, fairly regular
bull-and-bear-market pattern will eventually return we do not
know. But it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to
base his present policy on the classic formula--i.e., to wait for
demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common
stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision
for changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the
portfolio, if the investor chooses to do so, according as the level
of stock prices appears less or more attractive by value stan-
dards.*

Formula Plans

   In the early years of the stock-market rise that began in 1949­50
considerable interest was attracted to various methods of taking
advantage of the stock market's cycles. These have been known as
"formula investment plans." The essence of all such plans--except
the simple case of dollar averaging--is that the investor automati-
cally does some selling of common stocks when the market
advances substantially. In many of them a very large rise in the
market level would result in the sale of all common-stock holdings;
others provided for retention of a minor proportion of equities
under all circumstances.

   This approach had the double appeal of sounding logical (and
conservative) and of showing excellent results when applied retro-
spectively to the stock market over many years in the past. Unfor-
tunately, its vogue grew greatest at the very time when it was
destined to work least well. Many of the "formula planners" found
themselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level
in the middle 1950s. True, they had realized excellent profits, but in
a broad sense the market "ran away" from them thereafter, and

* Graham discusses this "recommended policy" in Chapter 4 (pp. 89­91).
This policy, now called "tactical asset allocation," is widely followed by insti-
tutional investors like pension funds and university endowments.
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  195

their formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common-
stock position.*

   There is a similarity between the experience of those adopting
the formula-investing approach in the early 1950s and those who
embraced the purely mechanical version of the Dow theory some
20 years earlier. In both cases the advent of popularity marked
almost the exact moment when the system ceased to work well. We
have had a like discomfiting experience with our own "central
value method" of determining indicated buying and selling levels
of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The moral seems to be that
any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be
easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too
simple and too easy to last. Spinoza's concluding remark applies
to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: "All things excellent are as
difficult as they are rare."

Market Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio

   Every investor who owns common stocks must expect to see
them fluctuate in value over the years. The behavior of the DJIA
since our last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty
well what has happened to the stock portfolio of a conservative
investor who limited his stock holdings to those of large, promi-
nent, and conservatively financed corporations. The overall value
advanced from an average level of about 890 to a high of 995 in

* Many of these "formula planners" would have sold all their stocks at the
end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the second-highest
yearly return then on record. Over the next five years, these market-timers
would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks doubled.
 Easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons: the
natural tendency of trends to reverse over time, or "regress to the mean,"
and the rapid adoption of the stock-picking scheme by large numbers of
people, who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got there first. (Note
that, in referring to his "discomfiting experience," Graham is--as always--
honest in admitting his own failures.) See Jason Zweig, "Murphy Was an
Investor," Money, July, 2002, pp. 61­62, and Jason Zweig, "New Year's
Play," Money, December, 2000, pp. 89­90.
196  The Intelligent Investor

1966 (and 985 again in 1968), fell to 631 in 1970, and made an
almost full recovery to 940 in early 1971. (Since the individual
issues set their high and low marks at different times, the fluc-
tuations in the Dow Jones group as a whole are less severe than
those in the separate components.) We have traced through the
price fluctuations of other types of diversified and conservative
common-stock portfolios and we find that the overall results are
not likely to be markedly different from the above. In general, the
shares of second-line companies* fluctuate more widely than the
major ones, but this does not necessarily mean that a group of well-
established but smaller companies will make a poorer showing
over a fairly long period. In any case the investor may as well
resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere
possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more
from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more
from their high point at various periods in the next five years.

   A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or
even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him
richer or poorer. But what about the longer-term and wider
changes? Here practical questions present themselves, and the psy-
chological problems are likely to grow complicated. A substantial
rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and
a cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring a strong tempta-
tion toward imprudent action. Your shares have advanced, good!

* Today's equivalent of what Graham calls "second-line companies" would
be any of the thousands of stocks not included in the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500 stocks in the S & P index
is available at www.standardandpoors.com.
 Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible, but prob-
able, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50% from their low-
est price and lose at least 33% from their highest price--regardless of which
stocks you own or whether the market as a whole goes up or down. If you
can't live with that--or you think your portfolio is somehow magically exempt
from it--then you are not yet entitled to call yourself an investor. (Graham
refers to a 33% decline as the "equivalent one-third" because a 50% gain
takes a $10 stock to $15. From $15, a 33% loss [or $5 drop] takes it right
back to $10, where it started.)
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  197

You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high,
and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for
not having bought more shares when the level was lower? Or--
worst thought of all--should you now give way to the bull-market
atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfi-
dence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are
a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented
thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but
even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will
power to keep from following the crowd.

   It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calcu-
lation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechan-
ical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the
investor's portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a
formula will give him something to do. As the market advances he
will from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings, putting
the proceeds into bonds; as it declines he will reverse the proce-
dure. These activities will provide some outlet for his otherwise
too-pent-up energies. If he is the right kind of investor he will take
added satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly
opposite from those of the crowd.*

Business Valuations versus Stock-Market Valuations

   The impact of market fluctuations upon the investor's true situ-
ation may be considered also from the standpoint of the share-
holder as the part owner of various businesses. The holder of
marketable shares actually has a double status, and with it the
privilege of taking advantage of either at his choice. On the one
hand his position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or
silent partner in a private business. Here his results are entirely
dependent on the profits of the enterprise or on a change in the
underlying value of its assets. He would usually determine the
value of such a private-business interest by calculating his share of
the net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheet. On the

* For today's investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this "formula" is rebal-
ancing, which we discuss on pp. 104­105.
198  The Intelligent Investor

other hand, the common-stock investor holds a piece of paper, an
engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes
at a price which varies from moment to moment--when the mar-
ket is open, that is--and often is far removed from the balance-
sheet value.*

   The development of the stock market in recent decades has
made the typical investor more dependent on the course of price
quotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a
business owner. The reason is that the successful enterprises in
which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly
at prices well above their net asset value (or book value, or
"balance-sheet value"). In paying these market premiums the
investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on
the stock market itself to validate his commitments.

   This is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing,
and it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-
ture of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.
The better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship
the price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greater
the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of deter-
mining its intrinsic value--i.e., the more this "value" will depend
on the changing moods and measurements of the stock market.
Thus we reach the final paradox, that the more successful the com-
pany, the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its
shares. This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the

* Most companies today provide "an engraved stock certificate" only upon
special request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely electronic form
(much as your bank account contains computerized credits and debits, not
actual currency) and thus have become even easier to trade than they were
in Graham's day.
 Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and tangible-asset value
are all synonyms for net worth, or the total value of a company's physical
and financial assets minus all its liabilities. It can be calculated using the bal-
ance sheets in a company's annual and quarterly reports; from total share-
holders' equity, subtract all "soft" assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and
other intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to
arrive at book value per share.

quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be--at
least as compared with the unspectacular middle-grade issues.*
(What we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth
companies with the bulk of well-established concerns; we exclude
from our purview here those issues which are highly speculative
because the businesses themselves are speculative.)

   The argument made above should explain the often erratic price
behavior of our most successful and impressive enterprises. Our
favorite example is the monarch of them all--International Busi-
ness Machines. The price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven
months in 1962­63; after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in
1970. Similarly, Xerox--an even more impressive earnings gainer
in recent decades--fell from 171 to 87 in 1962­63, and from 116 to
65 in 1970. These striking losses did not indicate any doubt about
the future long-term growth of IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead
a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock mar-
ket itself had placed on these excellent prospects.

   The previous discussion leads us to a conclusion of practical
importance to the conservative investor in common stocks. If he is
to pay some special attention to the selection of his portfolio, it
might be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reason-
ably close approximation to their tangible-asset value--say, at not
more than one-third above that figure. Purchases made at such
levels, or lower, may with logic be regarded as related to the

* Graham's use of the word "paradox" is probably an allusion to a classic
article by David Durand, "Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox," The
Journal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957, pp. 348­363, which
compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to betting on a series of
coin flips in which the payoff escalates with each flip of the coin. Durand
points out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for
an indefinite period of time, an investor should (in theory) be willing to pay
an infinite price for its shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a
price of infinity dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future
growth rate, and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the
wider the margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis-
calculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in Appendix 4
(p. 570).

company's balance sheet, and as having a justification or support
independent of the fluctuating market prices. The premium over
book value that may be involved can be considered as a kind of
extra fee paid for the advantage of stock-exchange listing and the
marketability that goes with it.

   A caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound
investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset
value. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio
of earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the
prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.
This may appear like demanding a lot from a modestly priced
stock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger-
ously high market conditions. Once the investor is willing to forgo
brilliant prospects--i.e., better than average expected growth--he
will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting
these criteria.

   In our chapters on the selection of common stocks (Chapters 14
and 15) we shall give data showing that more than half of the DJIA
issues met our asset-value criterion at the end of 1970. The most
widely held investment of all--American Tel. & Tel.--actually sells
below its tangible-asset value as we write. Most of the light-and-
power shares, in addition to their other advantages, are now (early
1972) available at prices reasonably close to their asset values.

   The investor with a stock portfolio having such book values
behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of
stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipli-
ers of both earnings and tangible assets. As long as the earning
power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little
attention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More
than that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master
game of buying low and selling high.

The A. & P. Example

   At this point we shall introduce one of our original examples,
which dates back many years but which has a certain fascination
for us because it combines so many aspects of corporate and
investment experience. It involves the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Co. Here is the story:
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  201

   A. & P. shares were introduced to trading on the "Curb" market,
now the American Stock Exchange, in 1929 and sold as high as 494.
By 1932 they had declined to 104, although the company's earnings
were nearly as large in that generally catastrophic year as previ-
ously. In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the busi-
ness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low
of 36.

   That price was extraordinary. It meant that the preferred and
common were together selling for $126 million, although the com-
pany had just reported that it held $85 million in cash alone and a
working capital (or net current assets) of $134 million. A. & P. was
the largest retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a
continuous and impressive record of large earnings for many
years. Yet in 1938 this outstanding business was considered on
Wall Street to be worth less than its current assets alone--which
means less as a going concern than if it were liquidated. Why?
First, because there were threats of special taxes on chain stores;
second, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and,
third, because the general market was depressed. The first of these
reasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless fear; the
other two were typical of temporary influences.

   Let us assume that the investor had bought A. & P. common in
1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80. We
are far from asserting that the ensuing decline to 36 was of no
importance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize
the picture with some care, to see whether he had made any mis-
calculations. But if the results of his study were reassuring--as
they should have been--he was entitled then to disregard the mar-
ket decline as a temporary vagary of finance, unless he had the
funds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on
the bargain basis offered.

Sequel and Reflections

   The following year, 1939, A. & P. shares advanced to 1171/2, or
three times the low price of 1938 and well above the average of
1937. Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no
means uncommon, but in the case of A. & P. it was more striking
than most. In the years after 1949 the grocery chain's shares rose
202  The Intelligent Investor

with the general market until in 1961 the split-up stock (10 for 1)
reached a high of 701/2 which was equivalent to 705 for the 1938
shares.

   This price of 701/2 was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the
earnings of 1961. Such a price/earnings ratio--which compares
with 23 times for the DJIA in that year--must have implied expec-
tations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no jus-
tification in the company's earnings record in the preceding years,
and it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the
course of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward.
The year after the 701/2 high the price fell by more than half to 34.
But this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they
showed at the low quotation in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctua-
tions the price fell to another low of 211/2 in 1970 and 18 in 1972--
having reported the first quarterly deficit in its history.

   We see in this history how wide can be the vicissitudes of a
major American enterprise in little more than a single generation,
and also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and
pessimism the public has valued its shares. In 1938 the business
was really being given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was
clamoring for the shares at a ridiculously high price. After that
came a quick loss of half the market value, and some years later a
substantial further decline. In the meantime the company was to
turn from an outstanding to a mediocre earnings performer; its
profit in the boom-year 1968 was to be less than in 1958; it had paid
a series of confusing small stock dividends not warranted by the
current additions to surplus; and so forth. A. & P. was a larger com-
pany in 1961 and 1972 than in 1938, but not as well-run, not as
profitable, and not as attractive.*

   There are two chief morals to this story. The first is that the stock
market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and coura-

* The more recent history of A & P is no different. At year-end 1999, its
share price was $27.875; at year-end 2000, $7.00; a year later, $23.78; at
year-end 2002, $8.06. Although some accounting irregularities later came
to light at A & P, it defies all logic to believe that the value of a relatively sta-
ble business like groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the
next year, then drop by two-thirds the year after that.

geous investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is
that most businesses change in character and quality over the
years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse.
The investor need not watch his companies' performance like a
hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.

   Let us return to our comparison between the holder of mar-
ketable shares and the man with an interest in a private business.
We have said that the former has the option of considering himself
merely as the part owner of the various businesses he has invested
in, or as the holder of shares which are salable at any time he
wishes at their quoted market price.

   But note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is
forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard
the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act
upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus
the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor-
ried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely
transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That
man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at
all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by
other persons' mistakes of judgment.

   Incidentally, a widespread situation of this kind actually existed
during the dark depression days of 1931­1933. There was then a
psychological advantage in owning business interests that had no
quoted market. For example, people who owned first mortgages
on real estate that continued to pay interest were able to tell them-
selves that their investments had kept their full value, there being
no market quotations to indicate otherwise. On the other hand,
many listed corporation bonds of even better quality and greater

* "Only to the extent that it suits his book" means "only to the extent that the
price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock." In traditional brokerage
lingo, the "book" is an investor's ledger of holdings and trades.
 This may well be the single most important paragraph in Graham's entire
book. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of experience. You
cannot read these words too often; they are like Kryptonite for bear markets.
If you keep them close at hand and let them guide you throughout your
investing life, you will survive whatever the markets throw at you.
204  The Intelligent Investor

underlying strength suffered severe shrinkages in their market
quotations, thus making their owners believe they were growing
distinctly poorer. In reality the owners were better off with the
listed securities, despite the low prices of these. For if they had
wanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold the
issues--possibly to exchange them for even better bargains. Or
they could just as logically have ignored the market's action as
temporary and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell
yourself that you have suffered no shrinkage in value merely
because your securities have no quoted market at all.

   Returning to our A. & P. shareholder in 1938, we assert that as
long as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price
decline, beyond what his own judgment may have told him was
occasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If
no such shrinkage had occurred, he had a right to expect that in
due course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or
better--as in fact it did the following year. In this respect his posi-
tion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private
business with no quoted market for its shares. For in that case, too,
he might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off
part of the cost of his holdings because of the impact of the 1938
recession--depending on what had happened to his company.

   Critics of the value approach to stock investment argue that
listed common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in
the same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because
the presence of an organized security market "injects into equity
ownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity."
But what this liquidity really means is, first, that the investor has
the benefit of the stock market's daily and changing appraisal of
his holdings, for whatever that appraisal may be worth, and, second,
that the investor is able to increase or decrease his investment at
the market's daily figure--if he chooses. Thus the existence of a
quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not
have if his security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current
quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from
some other source.

   Let us close this section with something in the nature of a para-
ble. Imagine that in some private business you own a small share
that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  205

very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your
interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to
sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of
value appears plausible and justified by business developments
and prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr.
Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the
value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.

   If you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you
let Mr. Market's daily communication determine your view of the
value of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree
with him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy
to sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price,
and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the
rest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the
value of your holdings, based on full reports from the company
about its operations and financial position.

   The true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed
common stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or
leave it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He
must take cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise
his judgment will have nothing to work on. Conceivably they may
give him a warning signal which he will do well to heed--this in
plain English means that he is to sell his shares because the price has
gone down, foreboding worse things to come. In our view such sig-
nals are misleading at least as often as they are helpful. Basically,
price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true
investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely
when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a
great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the
stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the
operating results of his companies.

Summary

   The most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec-
ulator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements.
The speculator's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting
from market fluctuations. The investor's primary interest lies in
acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market
206  The Intelligent Investor

movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they
alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to
buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from
buying and probably would be wise to sell.

   It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly
hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may
involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible
missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better
for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to
put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher
than can be justified by well-established standards of value. If he
wants to be shrewd he can look for the ever-present bargain oppor-
tunities in individual securities.

   Aside from forecasting the movements of the general market,
much effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting
stocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will "do better"
than the rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this
endeavor may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or
temperament of the true investor--particularly since he would be
competing with a large number of stock-market traders and first-
class financial analysts who are trying to do the same thing. As
in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and
underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds con-
stantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-
defeating over the years.

   The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their
prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable
declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should
always remember that market quotations are there for his conve-
nience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should
never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has
gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more
simply: "Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or
sell one immediately after a substantial drop."

An Added Consideration

   Something should be said about the significance of average mar-
ket prices as a measure of managerial competence. The shareholder
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  207

judges whether his own investment has been successful in terms
both of dividends received and of the long-range trend of the aver-
age market value. The same criteria should logically be applied in
testing the effectiveness of a company's management and the
soundness of its attitude toward the owners of the business.

   This statement may sound like a truism, but it needs to be
emphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approach
by which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On
the contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no
responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of
their shares. It is true, of course, that they are not accountable for
those fluctuations in price which, as we have been insisting, bear no
relationship to underlying conditions and values. But it is only the
lack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of share-
holders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of
market quotations, including the permanent establishment of a
depreciated and unsatisfactory price level. Good managements
produce a good average market price, and bad managements pro-
duce bad market prices.*

Fluctuations in Bond Prices

   The investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin-
cipal and interest may be unquestioned, a long-term bond could
vary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates.
In Table 8-1 we give data for various years back to 1902 covering
yields for high-grade corporate and tax-free issues. As individual
illustrations we add the price fluctuations of two representative
railroad issues for a similar period. (These are the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe general mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of
our premier noncallable bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry.
3s, due 2047--originally a 150-year maturity!--long a typical Baa-
rated bond.)

   Because of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond
to the high prices and vice versa. The decline in the Northern

* Graham has much more to say on what is now known as "corporate gov-
ernance." See the commentary on Chapter 19.
208  The Intelligent Investor

Pacific 3s in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the
issue. It is extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high
in the next few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly
because of the rise in general interest rates. There have been star-
tling variations, as well, in the price of even the highest-grade
bonds in the past forty years.

   Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro-
portion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value
of 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long
maturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields
change at close to the same rate.

   Since 1964 record movements in both directions have taken place
in the high-grade bond market. Taking "prime municipals" (tax-
free) as an example, their yield more than doubled, from 3.2% in
January 1965 to 7% in June 1970. Their price index declined, corre-
spondingly, from 110.8 to 67.5. In mid-1970 the yields on high-
grade long-term bonds were higher than at any time in the nearly
200 years of this country's economic history.* Twenty-five years earlier,
just before our protracted bull market began, bond yields were at
their lowest point in history; long-term municipals returned as little
as 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared with the 41/2 to 5% for-
merly considered "normal." Those of us with a long experience on
Wall Street had seen Newton's law of "action and reaction, equal
and opposite" work itself out repeatedly in the stock market--the
most noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA from 64 in
1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But
this time the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually
staid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields.
Moral: Nothing important on Wall Street can be counted on to
occur exactly in the same way as it happened before. This repre-

* By what Graham called "the rule of opposites," in 2002 the yields on long-
term U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963. Since bond
yields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that prices had
risen--making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most
expensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low. This
provides another proof of Graham's lesson that the intelligent investor must
refuse to make decisions based on market fluctuations.

sents the first half of our favorite dictum: "The more it changes, the
more it's the same thing."

   If it is virtually impossible to make worthwhile predictions
about the price movements of stocks, it is completely impossible to
do so for bonds.* In the old days, at least, one could often find a
useful clue to the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying
the prior action of bonds, but no similar clues were given to a com-
ing change in interest rates and bond prices. Hence the investor
must choose between long-term and short-term bond investments
on the basis chiefly of his personal preferences. If he wants to be
certain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are
probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described
above, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first
year), the Series E for up to 55/6 years, the Series H for up to ten
years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.

   If the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term
corporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be
prepared to see them fluctuate in price. Banks and insurance com-
panies have the privilege of valuing high-rated bonds of this type
on the mathematical basis of "amortized cost," which disregards
market prices; it would not be a bad idea for the individual
investor to do something similar.

   The price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks
are the resultant of three different factors: (1) variations in the
price of the related common stock, (2) variations in the credit
standing of the company, and (3) variations in general interest
rates. A good many of the convertible issues have been sold by
companies that have credit ratings well below the best.3 Some of
these were badly affected by the financial squeeze in 1970. As a
result, convertible issues as a whole have been subjected to triply
unsettling influences in recent years, and price variations have
been unusually wide. In the typical case, therefore, the investor
would delude himself if he expected to find in convertible issues
that ideal combination of the safety of a high-grade bond and price

wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be found in the
commentary on Chapter 4.
The Investor and Market Fluctuations  211

protection plus a chance to benefit from an advance in the price of
the common.

   This may be a good place to make a suggestion about the "long-
term bond of the future." Why should not the effects of changing
interest rates be divided on some practical and equitable basis
between the borrower and the lender? One possibility would be to
sell long-term bonds with interest payments that vary with an
appropriate index of the going rate. The main results of such an
arrangement would be: (1) the investor's bond would always have
a principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit
rating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered
on conventional new issues; (2) the corporation would have the
advantages of long-term debt--being spared problems and costs of
frequent renewals of refinancing--but its interest costs would
change from year to year.4

   Over the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by
an increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability
of principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)
interest rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with
considerable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his princi-
pal value? It would be good for most investors if they could
compromise between these extremes, and be assured that neither
their interest return nor their principal value will fall below a
stated minimum over, say, a 20-year period. This could be
arranged, without great difficulty, in an appropriate bond contract
of a new form. Important note: In effect the U.S. government has
done a similar thing in its combination of the original savings-
bonds contracts with their extensions at higher interest rates. The
suggestion we make here would cover a longer fixed investment
period than the savings bonds, and would introduce more flexibil-
ity in the interest-rate provisions.*

   It is hardly worthwhile to talk about nonconvertible preferred
stocks, since their special tax status makes the safe ones much more
desirable holdings by corporations--e.g., insurance companies--

Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version of what Gra-
ham is suggesting here.

than by individuals. The poorer-quality ones almost always fluctu-

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 8

   The happiness of those who want to be popular depends on
   others; the happiness of those who seek pleasure fluctuates
   with moods outside their control; but the happiness of the wise
   grows out of their own free acts.

                                                              --Marcus Aurelius

DR. JEKYLL AND MR. MARKET
Most of the time, the market is mostly accurate in pricing most stocks.
Millions of buyers and sellers haggling over price do a remarkably
good job of valuing companies--on average. But sometimes, the price
is not right; occasionally, it is very wrong indeed. And at such times,
you need to understand Graham's image of Mr. Market, probably
the most brilliant metaphor ever created for explaining how stocks
can become mispriced.1 The manic-depressive Mr. Market does not
always price stocks the way an appraiser or a private buyer would
value a business. Instead, when stocks are going up, he happily pays
more than their objective value; and, when they are going down, he is
desperate to dump them for less than their true worth.

   Is Mr. Market still around? Is he still bipolar? You bet he is.
   On March 17, 2000, the stock of Inktomi Corp. hit a new high of
$231.625. Since they first came on the market in June 1998, shares
in the Internet-searching software company had gained roughly
1,900%. Just in the few weeks since December 1999, the stock had
nearly tripled.
   What was going on at Inktomi the business that could make Inktomi
the stock so valuable? The answer seems obvious: phenomenally fast

                                                                                           213

growth. In the three months ending in December 1999, Inktomi sold
$36 million in products and services, more than it had in the entire
year ending in December 1998. If Inktomi could sustain its growth
rate of the previous 12 months for just five more years, its revenues
would explode from $36 million a quarter to $5 billion a month. With
such growth in sight, the faster the stock went up, the farther up it
seemed certain to go.

   But in his wild love affair with Inktomi's stock, Mr. Market was over-
looking something about its business. The company was losing
money--lots of it. It had lost $6 million in the most recent quarter, $24
million in the 12 months before that, and $24 million in the year before
that. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in
profits. Yet, on March 17, 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at
a total of $25 billion. (Yes, that's billion, with a B.)

   And then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression.
On September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting
$231.625 per share, Inktomi's stock closed at 25 cents--collapsing
from a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Had
Inktomi's business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,
the company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what had
changed? Only Mr. Market's mood: In early 2000, investors were
so wild about the Internet that they priced Inktomi's shares at 250
times the company's revenues. Now, however, they would pay only
0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr.
Hyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool
out of him.

   But Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he
had been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.
announced that it would buy Inktomi for $1.65 per share. That was
nearly seven times Inktomi's stock price on September 30. History will
probably show that Yahoo! got a bargain. When Mr. Market makes
stocks so cheap, it's no wonder that entire companies get bought
right out from under him.2

2 As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great Depres-
sion caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the value of
their cash and other liquid assets, making them "worth more dead than
alive."

TH I N K FOR YOU R S E LF

Would you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least five
times a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he feels?
Would you ever agree to be euphoric just because he is--or miserable
just because he thinks you should be? Of course not. You'd insist on
your right to take control of your own emotional life, based on your
experiences and your beliefs. But, when it comes to their financial
lives, millions of people let Mr. Market tell them how to feel and what to
do--despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can get nuttier
than a fruitcake.

   In 1999, when Mr. Market was squealing with delight, American
employees directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their
401(k) retirement plans. By 2002, after Mr. Market had spent three
years stuffing stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribu-
tion rate had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%.3 The cheaper
stocks got, the less eager people became to buy them--because they
were imitating Mr. Market, instead of thinking for themselves.

   The intelligent investor shouldn't ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead,
you should do business with him--but only to the extent that it serves
your interests. Mr. Market's job is to provide you with prices; your job
is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not
have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.

   By refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into
your servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values,
he is creating them elsewhere. In 1999, the Wilshire 5000 index--the
broadest measure of U.S. stock performance--gained 23.8%, pow-
ered by technology and telecommunications stocks. But 3,743 of the
7,234 stocks in the Wilshire index went down in value even as the
average was rising. While those high-tech and telecom stocks were
hotter than the hood of a race car on an August afternoon, thousands
of "Old Economy" shares were frozen in the mud--getting cheaper and
cheaper.

start-up firms, went up an astonishing 939.9% in 1999. Meanwhile, Berk-
shire Hathaway--the holding company through which Graham's greatest
disciple, Warren Buffett, owns such Old Economy stalwarts as Coca-
Cola, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co.--dropped by 24.9%.4

   But then, as it so often does, the market had a sudden mood
swing. Figure 8-1 offers a sampling of how the stinkers of 1999 be-
came the stars of 2000 through 2002.

   As for those two holding companies, CMGI went on to lose 96% in
2000, another 70.9% in 2001, and still 39.8% more in 2002--a cumulative
loss of 99.3%. Berkshire Hathaway went up 26.6% in 2000 and 6.5% in
2001, then had a slight 3.8% loss in 2002--a cumulative gain of 30%.

CAN YOU B EAT TH E PR OS AT TH E I R OWN GAM E?

One of Graham's most powerful insights is this: "The investor who
permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified mar-
ket declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advan-
tage into a basic disadvantage."

   What does Graham mean by those words "basic advantage"? He
means that the intelligent individual investor has the full freedom to
choose whether or not to follow Mr. Market. You have the luxury of
being able to think for yourself.5

4 A few months later, on March 10, 2000--the very day that NASDAQ hit its all-
time high--online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he had "repeat-
edly" been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway short, a bet that
Buffett's stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar thrust of his rhetorical pelvis,
Cramer even declared that Berkshire's shares were "ripe for the banging." That
same day, market strategist Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked,
"Norfolk Southern or Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?"
Cisco, a key to tomorrow's Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over
Norfolk Southern, part of yesterday's railroad system. (Over the next year, Nor-
folk Southern gained 35%, while Cisco lost 70%.)
5 When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding, Gra-
ham had a concise answer: "The primary cause of failure is that they pay too
much attention to what the stock market is doing currently." See "Benjamin
Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis" [transcript of lecture at Northeast
Missouri State University Business School, March, 1972], Financial History
magazine, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 8.
218  Commentary on Chapter 8

   The typical money manager, however, has no choice but to mimic Mr.
Market's every move--buying high, selling low, marching almost mind-
lessly in his erratic footsteps. Here are some of the handicaps mutual-
fund managers and other professional investors are saddled with:

· With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate
     toward the biggest stocks--the only ones they can buy in the
     multimillion-dollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus
     many funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants.

· Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises.
     The managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they
     already own, driving prices to even more dangerous heights.

· If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops,
     the managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as
     the funds are forced to buy stocks at inflated prices in a rising
     market, they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again.

· Many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market, so
     they obsessively measure their returns against benchmarks like
     the S & P 500 index. If a company gets added to an index, hun-
     dreds of funds compulsively buy it. (If they don't, and that stock
     then does well, the managers look foolish; on the other hand, if
     they buy it and it does poorly, no one will blame them.)

· Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in
     medicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric
     allergist and the geriatric otolaryngologist, fund managers must
     buy only "small growth" stocks, or only "mid-sized value" stocks,
     or nothing but "large blend" stocks.6 If a company gets too big, or
     too small, or too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has
     to sell it--even if the manager loves the stock.

   So there's no reason you can't do as well as the pros. What you
cannot do (despite all the pundits who say you can) is to "beat the
pros at their own game." The pros can't even win their own game!
Why should you want to play it at all? If you follow their rules, you will
lose--since you will end up as much a slave to Mr. Market as the pro-
fessionals are.

6 Never mind what these terms mean, or are supposed to mean. While in
public these classifications are treated with the utmost respect, in private
most people in the investment business regard them with the contempt nor-
mally reserved for jokes that aren't funny.
Commentary on Chapter 8  219

   Instead, recognize that investing intelligently is about controlling
the controllable. You can't control whether the stocks or funds you buy
will outperform the market today, next week, this month, or this year; in
the short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and
his whims. But you can control:

· your brokerage costs, by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply
· your ownership costs, by refusing to buy mutual funds with

     excessive annual expenses
· your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your

     returns7
· your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at

     hazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing
· your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, when-

     ever possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains lia-
     bility
· and, most of all, your own behavior.

   If you listen to financial TV, or read most market columnists, you'd
think that investing is some kind of sport, or a war, or a struggle for
survival in a hostile wilderness. But investing isn't about beating oth-
ers at their game. It's about controlling yourself at your own game.
The challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that
will go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent yourself
from being your own worst enemy--from buying high just because Mr.
Market says "Buy!" and from selling low just because Mr. Market says
"Sell!"

   If you investment horizon is long--at least 25 or 30 years--there is
only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and
whenever else you can spare some money. The single best choice for
this lifelong holding is a total stock-market index fund. Sell only when
you need the cash (for a psychological boost, clip out and sign your
"Investment Owner's Contract"--which you can find on p. 225).

   To be an intelligent investor, you must also refuse to judge your
financial success by how a bunch of total strangers are doing. You're
not one penny poorer if someone in Dubuque or Dallas or Denver

beats the S & P 500 and you don't. No one's gravestone reads "HE
BEAT THE MARKET."

   I once interviewed a group of retirees in Boca Raton, one of
Florida's wealthiest retirement communities. I asked these people--
mostly in their seventies--if they had beaten the market over their
investing lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no; most weren't sure.
Then one man said, "Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned
enough for me to end up in Boca."

   Could there be a more perfect answer? After all, the whole point of
investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough
money to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your invest-
ing success is not by whether you're beating the market but by
whether you've put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline
that are likely to get you where you want to go. In the end, what mat-
ters isn't crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making
sure that you do cross it.8

YOU R MON EY AN D YOU R B RAI N

Why, then, do investors find Mr. Market so seductive? It turns out that
our brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble; humans are
pattern-seeking animals. Psychologists have shown that if you present
people with a random sequence--and tell them that it's unpre-
dictable--they will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what's coming
next. Likewise, we "know" that the next roll of the dice will be a seven,
that a baseball player is due for a base hit, that the next winning num-
ber in the Powerball lottery will definitely be 4-27-9-16-42-10--and
that this hot little stock is the next Microsoft.

   Groundbreaking new research in neuroscience shows that our
brains are designed to perceive trends even where they might not
exist. After an event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of
the human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens
automatically anticipate that it will happen again. If it does repeat, a
natural chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with
a soft euphoria. Thus, if a stock goes up a few times in a row, you
reflexively expect it to keep going--and your brain chemistry changes

as the stock rises, giving you a "natural high." You effectively become
addicted to your own predictions.

   But when stocks drop, that financial loss fires up your amygdala--
the part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the
famous "fight or flight" response that is common to all cornered ani-
mals. Just as you can't keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm
goes off, just as you can't avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto
your hiking path, you can't help feeling fearful when stock prices are
plunging.9

   In fact, the brilliant psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tver-
sky have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as
intense as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. Making $1,000 on a
stock feels great--but a $1,000 loss wields an emotional wallop more
than twice as powerful. Losing money is so painful that many people,
terrified at the prospect of any further loss, sell out near the bottom or
refuse to buy more.

   That helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market
decline and forget to put the loss in proportion. So, if a TV reporter
hollers, "The market is plunging--the Dow is down 100 points! " most
people instinctively shudder. But, at the Dow's recent level of 8,000,
that's a drop of just 1.2%. Now think how ridiculous it would sound if,
on a day when it's 81 degrees outside, the TV weatherman shrieked,
"The temperature is plunging--it's dropped from 81 degrees to 80
degrees! " That, too, is a 1.2% drop. When you forget to view chang-
ing market prices in percentage terms, it's all too easy to panic over
minor vibrations. (If you have decades of investing ahead of you,
there's a better way to visualize the financial news broadcasts; see the
sidebar on p. 222.)

   In the late 1990s, many people came to feel that they were in the
dark unless they checked the prices of their stocks several times a
day. But, as Graham puts it, the typical investor "would be better off if
his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared
the mental anguish caused him by other persons' mistakes of judg-

Stocks are crashing, so you turn on the television to catch the
latest market news. But instead of CNBC or CNN, imagine that
you can tune in to the Benjamin Graham Financial Network. On
BGFN, the audio doesn't capture that famous sour clang of the
market's closing bell; the video doesn't home in on brokers
scurrying across the floor of the stock exchange like angry
rodents. Nor does BGFN run any footage of investors gasping
on frozen sidewalks as red arrows whiz overhead on electronic
stock tickers.

   Instead, the image that fills your TV screen is the facade of
the New York Stock Exchange, festooned with a huge banner
reading: "SALE! 50% OFF!" As intro music, Bachman-Turner
Overdrive can be heard blaring a few bars of their old barn-
burner, "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet." Then the anchorman
announces brightly, "Stocks became more attractive yet again
today, as the Dow dropped another 2.5% on heavy volume--the
fourth day in a row that stocks have gotten cheaper. Tech
investors fared even better, as leading companies like Microsoft
lost nearly 5% on the day, making them even more affordable.
That comes on top of the good news of the past year, in which
stocks have already lost 50%, putting them at bargain levels not
seen in years. And some prominent analysts are optimistic that
prices may drop still further in the weeks and months to come."

   The newscast cuts over to market strategist Ignatz Anderson
of the Wall Street firm of Ketchum & Skinner, who says, "My
forecast is for stocks to lose another 15% by June. I'm cau-
tiously optimistic that if everything goes well, stocks could lose
25%, maybe more."

   "Let's hope Ignatz Anderson is right," the anchor says cheer-
ily. "Falling stock prices would be fabulous news for any
investor with a very long horizon. And now over to Wally Wood

ment." If, after checking the value of your stock portfolio at 1:24 P.M.,
you feel compelled to check it all over again at 1:37 P.M., ask yourself
these questions:

· Did I call a real-estate agent to check the market price of my
     house at 1:24 P.M.? Did I call back at 1:37 P.M.?

· If I had, would the price have changed? If it did, would I have
     rushed to sell my house?

· By not checking, or even knowing, the market price of my house
     from minute to minute, do I prevent its value from rising over time?10

   The only possible answer to these questions is of course not! And
you should view your portfolio the same way. Over a 10- or 20- or 30-
year investment horizon, Mr. Market's daily dipsy-doodles simply do not
matter. In any case, for anyone who will be investing for years to come,
falling stock prices are good news, not bad, since they enable you to
buy more for less money. The longer and further stocks fall, and the
more steadily you keep buying as they drop, the more money you will
make in the end--if you remain steadfast until the end. Instead of fear-
ing a bear market, you should embrace it. The intelligent investor
should be perfectly comfortable owning a stock or mutual fund even if
the stock market stopped supplying daily prices for the next 10 years.11

   Paradoxically, "you will be much more in control," explains neurosci-
entist Antonio Damasio, "if you realize how much you are not in con-
trol." By acknowledging your biological tendency to buy high and sell
low, you can admit the need to dollar-cost average, rebalance, and
sign an investment contract. By putting much of your portfolio on per-
manent autopilot, you can fight the prediction addiction, focus on your
long-term financial goals, and tune out Mr. Market's mood swings.

10 It's also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your house if its
market price was reported to the last penny every day in the newspapers
and on TV.
11 In a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s, a psychologist at
Columbia and Harvard, Paul Andreassen, showed that investors who
received frequent news updates on their stocks earned half the returns of
investors who got no news at all. See Jason Zweig, "Here's How to Use the

WH E N M R. MAR KET G IVE S YOU LE MON S,
MAKE LEMONADE

Although Graham teaches that you should buy when Mr. Market is
yelling "sell," there's one exception the intelligent investor needs to
understand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a
tax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your
realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your
shares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income.12 Let's say you
bought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for $60 a
share--a total investment of $12,000. By year-end 2002, the stock
was down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lot--a loss of $3,200.

   You could have done what most people do--either whine about
your loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.
Or you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have
sold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after wait-
ing 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of
Coke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your tax-
able income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining
$200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would
still own a company whose future you believe in--but now you would
own it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.13

   With Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell
and lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logical
by comparison, who are we to complain?

12 Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of Coca-Cola
stock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax code as it stood
in early 2003.
13 This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital gains in
2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends. Tax swaps are not to be
undertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before doing a tax
swap, read IRS Publication 550 (www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf). A
good guide to managing your investment taxes is Robert N. Gordon with
Jan M. Rosen, Wall Street Secrets for Tax-Efficient Investing (Bloomberg
Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 2001). Finally, before you pull the trigger, con-
sult a professional tax adviser.

CHAPTER 9

Investing in Investment Funds

One course open to the defensive investor is to put his money

into investment-company shares. Those that are redeemable on
demand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as
"mutual funds" (or "open-end funds"). Most of these are actively
selling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with
nonredeemable shares are called "closed-end" companies or funds;
the number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of the
funds of any importance are registered with the Securities &
Exchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and
controls.*

   The industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were
383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-
lions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutual
funds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.

   There are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the
broad division of their portfolio; they are "balanced funds" if they
have a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,
or "stock-funds" if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.
(There are some other varieties here, such as "bond funds," "hedge

* It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end
fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has
"registered" (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.
 The fund industry has gone from "very large" to immense. At year-end
2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-end
funds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFs
with $109.7 billion. These figures exclude such fund-like investments as
variable annuities and unit investment trusts.

funds," "letter-stock funds," etc.)* Another is by their objectives, as
their primary aim is for income, price stability, or capital apprecia-
tion ("growth"). Another distinction is by their method of sale.
"Load funds" add a selling charge (generally about 9% of asset
value on minimum purchases) to the value before charge.1 Others,
known as "no-load" funds, make no such charge; the manage-
ments are content with the usual investment-counsel fees for han-
dling the capital. Since they cannot pay salesmen's commissions,
the size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side. The buy-
ing and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by the
companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary
corporate stock.

   Most of the companies operate under special provisions of the
income-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double
taxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out vir-
tually all their ordinary income--i.e., dividends and interest
received, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized
long-term profits on sales of investments--in the form of "capital-
gains dividends"--which are treated by the shareholder as if they
were his own security profits. (There is another option here, which
we omit to avoid clutter.) Nearly all the funds have but one class

* Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at www.ici.org/
pdf/g2understanding.pdf and http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/
CategoryReturns.html. Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds
are generally banned by SEC rules from selling shares to any investor
whose annual income is below $200,000 or whose net worth is below $1
million.
 Today, the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around 5.75%.
If you invest $10,000 in a fund with a flat 5.75% sales load, $575 will go to
the person (and brokerage firm) that sold it to you, leaving you with an initial
net investment of $9,425. The $575 sales charge is actually 6.1% of that
amount, which is why Graham calls the standard way of calculating the
charge a "sales gimmick." Since the 1980s, no-load funds have become
popular, and they no longer tend to be smaller than load funds.
 Nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a "regulated investment company,"
or RIC, which is exempt from corporate income tax so long as it
pays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders. In the "option" that

of security outstanding. A new wrinkle, introduced in 1967, divides
the capitalization into a preferred issue, which will receive all the
ordinary income, and a capital issue, or common stock, which will
receive all the profits on security sales. (These are called "dual-
purpose funds.")*

   Many of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital
gains concentrate on the purchase of the so-called "growth stocks,"
and they often have the word "growth" in their name. Some spe-
cialize in a designated area such as chemicals, aviation, overseas
investments; this is usually indicated in their titles.

   The investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in
fund shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of
choices before him--not too different from those offered in direct
investment. In this chapter we shall deal with some major ques-
tions, viz:

   1. Is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of
better than average results by choosing the right funds? (Subques-
tion: What about the "performance funds"?)

   2. If not, how can he avoid choosing funds that will give him
worse than average results?

   3. Can he make intelligent choices between different types of
funds--e.g., balanced versus all-stock, open-end versus closed-
end, load versus no-load?

Graham omits "to avoid clutter," a fund can ask the SEC for special permis-
sion to distribute one of its holdings directly to the fund's shareholders--as
his Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling out shares in GEICO to
Graham-Newman's own investors. This sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare.
* Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially disap-
peared from the marketplace--a shame, since they offered investors a more
flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like John
Neff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a renaissance of this
attractive investment vehicle.
 "Performance funds" were all the rage in the late 1960s. They were equiv-
alent to the aggressive growth funds of the late 1990s, and served their
investors no better.
Investing in Investment Funds  229

Investment-Fund Performance as a Whole

   Before trying to answer these questions we should say some-
thing about the performance of the fund industry as a whole. Has
it done a good job for its shareholders? In the most general way,
how have fund investors fared as against those who made their
investments directly? We are quite certain that the funds in the
aggregate have served a useful purpose. They have promoted
good habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-
less individuals against costly mistakes in the stock market; they
have brought their participants income and profits commensurate
with the overall returns from common stocks. On a comparative
basis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who
put his money exclusively in investment-fund shares in the past
ten years has fared better than the average person who made his
common-stock purchases directly.

   The last point is probably true even though the actual perfor-
mance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com-
mon stocks as a whole, and even though the cost of investing in
mutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases.
The real choice of the average individual has not been between
constructing and acquiring a well-balanced common-stock portfo-
lio or doing the same thing, a bit more expensively, by buying into
the funds. More likely his choice has been between succumbing to
the wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one
hand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and much more
dangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings. We
cannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a
brokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-
stock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ-
ences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these
temptations should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.

   But how have the investment funds performed as against the
general market? This is a somewhat controversial subject, but we
shall try to deal with it in simple but adequate fashion. Table 9-1
gives some calculated results for 1961­1970 of our ten largest stock
funds at the end of 1970, but choosing only the largest one from
each management group. It summarizes the overall return of each
of these funds for 1961­1965, 1966­1970, and for the single years

1969 and 1970. We also give average results based on the sum of
one share of each of the ten funds. These companies had combined
assets of over $15 billion at the end of 1969, or about one-third of all
the common-stock funds. Thus they should be fairly representative
of the industry as a whole. (In theory, there should be a bias in this
list on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-
ter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion
than the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)

   Some interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we
find that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961­1970 were
not appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor's 500-
stock composite average (or the S & P 425-industrial stock aver-
age). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA. (This
raises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA
did worse than the much more numerous and apparently rather
miscellaneous list used by Standard & Poor's.)* A second point is
that the funds' aggregate performance as against the S & P index
has improved somewhat in the last five years, compared with the
preceding five. The funds' gain ran a little lower than S & P's in
1961­1965 and a little higher than S & P's in 1966­1970. The third
point is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-
vidual funds.

   We do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for
doing no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and
their professional competitors administer so large a portion of all
marketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a
whole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their
funds. (Note that the trust assets of insured commercial banks
included $181 billion of common stocks at the end of 1969; if we
add to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment
advisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must
conclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty
well determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the

* For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500
can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course of the typical investing
lifetime, however--say 25 to 50 years--their returns have tended to converge
quite closely.
232  The Intelligent Investor

movement of the stock averages pretty well determines the funds'
aggregate results.)

   Are there better than average funds and can the investor select
these so as to obtain superior results for himself? Obviously all
investors could not do this, since in that case we would soon be
back where we started, with no one doing better than anyone else.
Let us consider the question first in a simplified fashion. Why
shouldn't the investor find out what fund has made the best show-
ing of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume
from this that its management is the most capable and will there-
fore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that
fund? This idea appears the more practicable because, in the case
of the mutual funds, he could obtain this "most capable manage-
ment" without paying any special premium for it as against the
other funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment corporations the
best-managed companies sell at correspondingly high prices in
relation to their current earnings and assets.)

   The evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years.
But our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the
results shown by the top five performers of 1961­1965 carried over
on the whole through 1966­1970, even though two of this set did not
do as well as two of the other five. Our studies indicate that the
investor in mutual-fund shares may properly consider compara-
tive performance over a period of years in the past, say at least five,
provided the data do not represent a large net upward movement of
the market as a whole. In the latter case spectacularly favorable
results may be achieved in unorthodox ways--as will be demon-
strated in our following section on "performance" funds. Such
results in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are
taking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the
time being.

"Performance" Funds

   One of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance
of the cult of "performance" in the management of investment
funds (and even of many trust funds). We must start this section
with the important disclaimer that it does not apply to the large
majority of well-established funds, but only to a relatively small
Investing in Investment Funds  233

section of the industry which has attracted a disproportionate
amount of attention. The story is simple enough. Some of those in
charge set out to get much better than average (or DJIA) results.
They succeeded in doing this for a while, garnering considerable
publicity and additional funds to manage. The aim was legitimate
enough; unfortunately, it appears that, in the context of investing
really sizable funds, the aim cannot be accomplished without
incurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively short time the risks
came home to roost.

   Several of the circumstances surrounding the "performance"
phenomenon caused ominous headshaking by those of us whose
experience went far back--even to the 1920s--and whose views,
for that very reason, were considered old-fashioned and irrelevant
to this (second) "New Era." In the first place, and on this very
point, nearly all these brilliant performers were young men--in
their thirties and forties--whose direct financial experience was
limited to the all but continuous bull market of 1948­1968. Sec-
ondly, they often acted as if the definition of a "sound investment"
was a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the
next few months. This led to large commitments in newer ventures
at prices completely disproportionate to their assets or recorded
earnings. They could be "justified" only by a combination of naïve
hope in the future accomplishments of these enterprises with an
apparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of
the uninformed and greedy public.

   This section will not mention people's names. But we have
every reason to give concrete examples of companies. The "perfor-
mance fund" most in the public's eye was undoubtedly Manhattan
Fund, Inc., organized at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27
million shares at $9.25 to $10 per share. The company started out
with $247 million of capital. Its emphasis was, of course, on capital
gains. Most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul-
tipliers of current earnings, paying no dividends (or very small
ones), with a large speculative following and spectacular price
movements. The fund showed an overall gain of 38.6% in 1967,
against 11% for the S & P composite index. But thereafter its perfor-
mance left much to be desired, as is shown in Table 9-2.

   The portfolio of Manhattan Fund at the end of 1969 was
unorthodox to say the least. It is an extraordinary fact that two of
its largest investments were in companies that filed for bankruptcy
within six months thereafter, and a third faced creditors' actions in
1971. It is another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of
these doomed companies were bought not only by investment
funds but by university endowment funds, the trust departments
of large banking institutions, and the like.* A third extraordinary
fact was that the founder-manager of Manhattan Fund sold his
stock in a separately organized management company to another
large concern for over $20 million in its stock; at that time the man-
agement company sold had less than $1 million in assets. This is
undoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between the
results for the "manager" and the "managees."

   A book published at the end of 19692 provided profiles of nine-
teen men "who are tops at the demanding game of managing bil-
lions of dollars of other people's money." The summary told us
further that "they are young . . . some earn more than a million dol-
lars a year . . . they are a new financial breed . . . they all have a
total fascination with the market . . . and a spectacular knack for
coming up with winners." A fairly good idea of the accomplish-
ments of this top group can be obtained by examining the pub-
lished results of the funds they manage. Such results are available
for funds directed by twelve of the nineteen persons described in
The Money Managers. Typically enough, they showed up well in
1966, and brilliantly in 1967. In 1968 their performance was still
good in the aggregate, but mixed as to individual funds. In 1969
they all showed losses, with only one managing to do a bit better
than the S & P composite index. In 1970 their comparative perfor-
mance was even worse than in 1969.

* One of the "doomed companies" Graham refers to was National Student
Marketing Corp., a con game masquerading as a stock, whose saga was
told brilliantly in Andrew Tobias's The Funny Money Game (Playboy Press,
New York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who were
snookered by NSM's charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the endow-
ment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such presti-
gious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.
236  The Intelligent Investor

   We have presented this picture in order to point a moral, which
perhaps can best be expressed by the old French proverb: Plus ça
change, plus c'est la même chose. Bright, energetic people--usually
quite young--have promised to perform miracles with "other
people's money" since time immemorial. They have usually been
able to do it for a while--or at least to appear to have done it--and
they have inevitably brought losses to their public in the end.*
About a half century ago the "miracles" were often accompanied
by flagrant manipulation, misleading corporate reporting, outra-
geous capitalization structures, and other semifraudulent financial
practices. All this brought on an elaborate system of financial con-
trols by the SEC, as well as a cautious attitude toward common
stocks on the part of the general public. The operations of the new
"money managers" in 1965­1969 came a little more than one full
generation after the shenanigans of 1926­1929. The specific mal-
practices banned after the 1929 crash were no longer resorted to--
they involved the risk of jail sentences. But in many corners of Wall
Street they were replaced by newer gadgets and gimmicks that
produced very similar results in the end. Outright manipulation of
prices disappeared, but there were many other methods of draw-
ing the gullible public's attention to the profit possibilities in "hot"
issues. Blocks of "letter stock"3 could be bought well below the
quoted market price, subject to undisclosed restrictions on their
sale; they could immediately be carried in the reports at their full
market value, showing a lovely and illusory profit. And so on. It is

* As only the latest proof that "the more things change, the more they stay
the same," consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder, launched
the Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a 216% return at
his previous dot-com fund. Investors poured nearly $300 million into
Jacob's fund in the first few weeks of 2000. It then proceeded to lose
79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002--a cumulative collapse of
92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob's investors even older and wiser
than it made him.
 Intriguingly, the disastrous boom and bust of 1999­2002 also came
roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes about
35 years for the investors who remember the last "New Economy" craze to
become less influential than those who do not. If this intuition is correct, the
intelligent investor should be particularly vigilant around the year 2030.

amazing how, in a completely different atmosphere of regulation
and prohibitions, Wall Street was able to duplicate so much of the
excesses and errors of the 1920s.

   No doubt there will be new regulations and new prohibitions.
The specific abuses of the late 1960s will be fairly adequately
banned from Wall Street. But it is probably too much to expect that
the urge to speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of
that urge can ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the
intelligent investor to know about these "Extraordinary Popular
Delusions,"4 and to keep as far away from them as possible.

   The picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we
start after their spectacular record in 1967. With the 1967 figures
included, their overall showing is not at all disastrous. On that
basis one of "The Money Managers" operators did quite a bit better
than the S & P composite index, three did distinctly worse, and six
did about the same. Let us take as a check another group of perfor-
mance funds--the ten that made the best showing in 1967, with
gains ranging from 84% up to 301% in that single year. Of these,
four gave a better overall four-year performance than the S & P
index, if the 1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in
1968­1970. None of these funds was large, and the average size
was about $60 million. Thus, there is a strong indication that
smaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand-
ing results.

   The foregoing account contains the implicit conclusion that
there may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor-
mance by investment-fund managers. All financial experience up
to now indicates that large funds, soundly managed, can produce
at best only slightly better than average results over the years. If
they are unsoundly managed they can produce spectacular, but
largely illusory, profits for a while, followed inevitably by calami-
tous losses. There have been instances of funds that have consis-
tently outperformed the market averages for, say, ten years or
more. But these have been scarce exceptions, having most of their
operations in specialized fields, with self-imposed limits on the
capital employed--and not actively sold to the public.*

* Today's equivalent of Graham's "scarce exceptions" tend to be open-end
funds that are closed to new investors--meaning that the managers have
238  The Intelligent Investor

Closed-End versus Open-End Funds

   Almost all the mutual funds or open-end funds, which offer
their holders the right to cash in their shares at each day's valua-
tion of the portfolio, have a corresponding machinery for selling
new shares. By this means most of them have grown in size over
the years. The closed-end companies, nearly all of which were
organized a long time ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus
have diminished in relative dollar importance. Open-end compa-
nies are being sold by many thousands of energetic and persuasive
salesmen, the closed-end shares have no one especially interested
in distributing them. Consequently it has been possible to sell most
"mutual funds" to the public at a fixed premium of about 9%
above net asset value (to cover salesmen's commissions, etc.),
while the majority of close-end shares have been consistently
obtainable at less than their asset value. This price discount has var-
ied among individual companies, and the average discount for the
group as a whole has also varied from one date to another. Figures
on this point for 1961­1970 are given in Table 9-3.

   It does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower rela-
tive price for closed-end as against open-end shares has very little
to do with the difference in the overall investment results between
the two groups. That this is true is indicated by the comparison of
the annual results for 1961­1970 of the two groups included in
Table 9-3.

   Thus we arrive at one of the few clearly evident rules for
investors' choices. If you want to put money in investment funds,
buy a group of closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15%
from asset value, instead of paying a premium of about 9% above
asset value for shares of an open-end company. Assuming that the
future dividends and changes in asset values continue to be about
the same for the two groups, you will thus obtain about one-fifth
more for your money from the closed-end shares.

   The mutual-fund salesman will be quick to counter with the

stopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the management fees
they can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing shareholders can earn.
Because most fund managers would rather look out for No. 1 than be No. 1,
closing a fund to new investors is a rare and courageous step.

argument: "Ah, but if you own closed-end shares you can never be
sure what price you can sell them for. The discount can be greater
than it is today, and you will suffer from the wider spread. With
our shares you are guaranteed the right to turn in your shares at
100% of asset value, never less." Let us examine this argument a
bit; it will be a good exercise in logic and plain common sense.
Question: Assuming that the discount on closed-end shares does
widen, how likely is it that you will be worse off with those shares
than with an otherwise equivalent purchase of open-end shares?

   This calls for a little arithmetic. Assume that Investor A buys
some open-end shares at 109% of asset value, and Investor B buys
closed-end shares at 85% thereof, plus 11/2% commission. Both sets
of shares earn and pay 30% of this asset value in, say, four years,

and end up with the same value as at the beginning. Investor A
redeems his shares at 100% of value, losing the 9% premium he
paid. His overall return for the period is 30% less 9%, or 21% on
asset value. This, in turn, is 19% on his investment. How much
must Investor B realize on his closed-end shares to obtain the same
return on his investment as Investor A? The answer is 73%, or a
discount of 27% from asset value. In other words, the closed-end
man could suffer a widening of 12 points in the market discount
(about double) before his return would get down to that of the
open-end investor. An adverse change of this magnitude has hap-
pened rarely, if ever, in the history of closed-end shares. Hence it is
very unlikely that you will obtain a lower overall return from a
(representative) closed-end company, bought at a discount, if its
investment performance is about equal to that of a representative
mutual fund. If a small-load (or no-load) fund is substituted for
one with the usual "81/2%" load, the advantage of the closed-end
investment is of course reduced, but it remains an advantage.

   The fact that a few closed-end funds are selling at premiums
greater than the true 9% charge on most mutual funds introduces a
separate question for the investor. Do these premium companies
enjoy superior management of sufficient proven worth to warrant
their elevated prices? If the answer is sought in the comparative
results for the past five or ten years, the answer would appear to be
no. Three of the six premium companies have mainly foreign
investments. A striking feature of these is the large variation in

prices in a few years' time; at the end of 1970 one sold at only one-
quarter of its high, another at a third, another at less than half. If we
consider the three domestic companies selling above asset value,
we find that the average of their ten-year overall returns was some-
what better than that of ten discount funds, but the opposite was
true in the last five years. A comparison of the 1961­1970 record of
Lehman Corp. and of General American Investors, two of our old-
est and largest closed-end companies, is given in Table 9-5. One of
these sold 14% above and the other 7.6% below its net-asset value
at the end of 1970. The difference in price to net-asset relationships
did not appear warranted by these figures.

Investment in Balanced Funds

   The 23 balanced funds covered in the Wiesenberger Report had
between 25% and 59% of their assets in preferred stocks and bonds,
the average being just 40%. The balance was held in common
stocks. It would appear more logical for the typical investor to
make his bond-type investments directly, rather than to have them
form part of a mutual-fund commitment. The average income
return shown by these balanced funds in 1970 was only 3.9% per
annum on asset value, or say 3.6% on the offering price. The better
choice for the bond component would be the purchase of United
States savings bonds, or corporate bonds rated A or better, or tax-
free bonds, for the investor's bond portfolio.

ALMOST PERFECT
A purely American creation, the mutual fund was introduced in 1924
by a former salesman of aluminum pots and pans named Edward G.
Leffler. Mutual funds are quite cheap, very convenient, generally diver-
sified, professionally managed, and tightly regulated under some of
the toughest provisions of Federal securities law. By making investing
easy and affordable for almost anyone, the funds have brought some
54 million American families (and millions more around the world) into
the investing mainstream--probably the greatest advance in financial
democracy ever achieved.

   But mutual funds aren't perfect; they are almost perfect, and that
word makes all the difference. Because of their imperfections, most
funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax
headaches, and suffer erratic swings in performance. The intelligent
investor must choose funds with great care in order to avoid ending
up owning a big fat mess.

Commentary on Chapter 9  243

TOP OF THE CHARTS

Most investors simply buy a fund that has been going up fast, on the
assumption that it will keep on going. And why not? Psychologists
have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the
long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.
What's more, we know from our own experience that some plumbers
are far better than others, that some baseball players are much more
likely to hit home runs, that our favorite restaurant serves consistently
superior food, and that smart kids get consistently good grades. Skill
and brains and hard work are recognized, rewarded--and consistently
repeated--all around us. So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition
tells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming.

   Unfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than
skill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at
just the right time, he will look brilliant--but all too often, what was hot
suddenly goes cold and the manager's IQ seems to shrivel by 50
points. Figure 9-1 shows what happened to the hottest funds of 1999.

   This is yet another reminder that the market's hottest market sec-
tor--in 1999, that was technology--often turns as cold as liquid nitro-
gen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning.1 And it's a reminder
that buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the
stupidest things an investor can do. Financial scholars have been
studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they
are virtually unanimous on several points:

· the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome
     its costs of researching and trading them;

· the higher a fund's expenses, the lower its returns;
· the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to

     earn;

dence is overwhelming: The most lucrative, and thus most popular, sector of

lowing year. Just as idle hands are the devil's workshop, sector funds are the
investor's nemesis.

· highly volatile funds, which bounce up and down more than aver-
     age, are likely to stay volatile;

· funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for
     long.2

   Your chances of selecting the top-performing funds of the future on
the basis of their returns in the past are about as high as the odds that
Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman will both show up in pink ballet
slippers at your next cocktail party. In other words, your chances are
not zero--but they're pretty close. (See sidebar, p. 255.)

   But there's good news, too. First of all, understanding why it's so
hard to find a good fund will help you become a more intelligent
investor. Second, while past performance is a poor predictor of future
returns, there are other factors that you can use to increase your odds
of finding a good fund. Finally, a fund can offer excellent value even if it
doesn't beat the market--by providing an economical way to diversify
your holdings and by freeing up your time for all the other things you
would rather be doing than picking your own stocks.

THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST

Why don't more winning funds stay winners?
   The better a fund performs, the more obstacles its investors face:
   Migrating managers. When a stock picker seems to have the

Midas touch, everyone wants him--including rival fund companies.
If you bought Transamerica Premier Equity Fund to cash in on the
skills of Glen Bickerstaff, who gained 47.5% in 1997, you were quickly
out of luck; TCW snatched him away in mid-1998 to run its TCW
Galileo Select Equities Fund, and the Transamerica fund lagged
the market in three of the next four years. If you bought Fidelity
Aggressive Growth Fund in early 2000 to capitalize on the high
returns of Erin Sullivan, who had nearly tripled her shareholders'
money since 1997, oh well: She quit to start her own hedge fund in

2000, and her former fund lost more than three-quarters of its value
over the next three years.3

   Asset elephantiasis. When a fund earns high returns, investors
notice--often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of
weeks. That leaves the fund manager with few choices--all of them
bad. He can keep that money safe for a rainy day, but then the low
returns on cash will crimp the fund's results if stocks keep going up.
He can put the new money into the stocks he already owns--which
have probably gone up since he first bought them and will become
dangerously overvalued if he pumps in millions of dollars more. Or he
can buy new stocks he didn't like well enough to own already--but he
will have to research them from scratch and keep an eye on far more
companies than he is used to following.

   Finally, when the $100-million Nimble Fund puts 2% of its assets
(or $2 million) in Minnow Corp., a stock with a total market value of
$500 million, it's buying up less than one-half of 1% of Minnow. But if
hot performance swells the Nimble Fund to $10 billion, then an invest-
ment of 2% of its assets would total $200 million--nearly half the
entire value of Minnow, a level of ownership that isn't even permissible
under Federal law. If Nimble's portfolio manager still wants to own
small stocks, he will have to spread his money over vastly more com-
panies--and probably end up spreading his attention too thin.

   No more fancy footwork. Some companies specialize in "incubat-
ing" their funds--test-driving them privately before selling them pub-
licly. (Typically, the only shareholders are employees and affiliates of
the fund company itself.) By keeping them tiny, the sponsor can use
these incubated funds as guinea pigs for risky strategies that work
best with small sums of money, like buying truly tiny stocks or rapid-fire
trading of initial public offerings. If its strategy succeeds, the fund can
lure public investors en masse by publicizing its private returns. In
other cases, the fund manager "waives" (or skips charging) manage-
ment fees, raising the net return--then slaps the fees on later after the
high returns attract plenty of customers. Almost without exception, the
returns of incubated and fee-waived funds have faded into mediocrity
after outside investors poured millions of dollars into them.

3 That's not to say that these funds would have done better if their "super-
star" managers had stayed in place; all we can be sure of is that the two
funds did poorly without them.
Commentary on Chapter 9  247

   Rising expenses. It often costs more to trade stocks in very large
blocks than in small ones; with fewer buyers and sellers, it's harder to
make a match. A fund with $100 million in assets might pay 1% a year
in trading costs. But, if high returns send the fund mushrooming up to
$10 billion, its trades could easily eat up at least 2% of those assets.
The typical fund holds on to its stocks for only 11 months at a time, so
trading costs eat away at returns like a corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the
other costs of running a fund rarely fall--and sometimes even rise--as
assets grow. With operating expenses averaging 1.5%, and trading
costs at around 2%, the typical fund has to beat the market by 3.5
percentage points per year before costs just to match it after costs!

   Sheepish behavior. Finally, once a fund becomes successful, its
managers tend to become timid and imitative. As a fund grows, its
fees become more lucrative--making its managers reluctant to rock
the boat. The very risks that the managers took to generate their initial
high returns could now drive investors away--and jeopardize all that fat
fee income. So the biggest funds resemble a herd of identical and
overfed sheep, all moving in sluggish lockstep, all saying "baaaa" at
the same time. Nearly every growth fund owns Cisco and GE and
Microsoft and Pfizer and Wal-Mart--and in almost identical propor-
tions. This behavior is so prevalent that finance scholars simply call it
herding.4 But by protecting their own fee income, fund managers com-
promise their ability to produce superior returns for their outside
investors.

4 There's a second lesson here: To succeed, the individual investor must
either avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that have already
been picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far more patiently.

   Because of their fat costs and bad behavior, most funds fail to earn
their keep. No wonder high returns are nearly as perishable as unre-
frigerated fish. What's more, as time passes, the drag of their exces-
sive expenses leaves most funds farther and farther behind, as Figure
9.2 shows.5

   What, then, should the intelligent investor do?

in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to select
the "best" and avoid the "worst"--will beat most funds over the long
run. (If your company doesn't offer a low-cost index fund in your
401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its
rock-bottom overhead--operating expenses of 0.2% annually, and
yearly trading costs of just 0.1%--give the index fund an insurmount-
able advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over
the next 20 years, a low-cost index fund like Vanguard Total Stock
Market will return just under 6.7%. (That would turn a $10,000 invest-
ment into more than $36,000.) But the average stock fund, with
its 1.5% in operating expenses and roughly 2% in trading costs, will
be lucky to gain 3.5% annually. (That would turn $10,000 into just
under $20,000--or nearly 50% less than the result from the index
fund.)

   Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. You'll
never be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the
top-performing fund in the country. You'll never be able to boast that
you beat the market, because the job of an index fund is to match the
market's return, not to exceed it. Your index-fund manager is not likely
to "roll the dice" and gamble that the next great industry will be tele-
portation, or scratch-'n'-sniff websites, or telepathic weight-loss clin-
ics; the fund will always own every stock, not just one manager's best
guess at the next new thing. But, as the years pass, the cost advan-
tage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly. Hold an index fund for
20 years or more, adding new money every month, and you are all but
certain to outperform the vast majority of professional and individual
investors alike. Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best
choice for individual investors, as does Warren Buffett.6

Street, Seymour Chatman, ed. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996), p. 273, and

Wall Street Legend (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), p. 273. As War-
ren Buffett wrote in his 1996 annual report: "Most investors, both institu-
tional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is
through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path
are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the
great majority of investment professionals." (See www.berkshirehathaway.

T I LT I N G T H E TA B L E S

When you add up all their handicaps, the wonder is not that so few
funds beat the index, but that any do. And yet, some do. What quali-
ties do they have in common?

   Their managers are the biggest shareholders. The conflict of
interest between what's best for the fund's managers and what's best
for its investors is mitigated when the managers are among the
biggest owners of the fund's shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Part-
ners, even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own
funds. At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers
own so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money
as if it were their own--lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let
the funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A
fund's proxy statement and Statement of Additional Information, both
available from the Securities and Exchange Commission through the
EDGAR database at www.sec.gov, disclose whether the managers
own at least 1% of the fund's shares.

   They are cheap. One of the most common myths in the fund busi-
ness is that "you get what you pay for"--that high returns are the best
justification for higher fees. There are two problems with this argu-
ment. First, it isn't true; decades of research have proven that funds
with higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns
are temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If
you buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful
of cold ashes--but your costs of owning the fund are almost certain
not to decline when its returns do.

   They dare to be different. When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he
bought whatever seemed cheap to him--regardless of what other fund
managers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;
right after that, he made Chrysler his top holding, even though most
experts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put
almost 20% of Fidelity Magellan in foreign stocks like Honda, Norsk
Hydro, and Volvo. So, before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the hold-
ings listed in its latest report against the roster of the S & P 500 index; if
they look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum, shop for another fund.7

   They shut the door. The best funds often close to new investors--
permitting only their existing shareholders to buy more. That stops the
feeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and pro-
tects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis. It's also a signal
that the fund managers are not putting their own wallets ahead of
yours. But the closing should occur before--not after--the fund
explodes in size. Some companies with an exemplary record of shut-
ting their own gates are Longleaf, Numeric, Oakmark, T. Rowe Price,
Vanguard, and Wasatch.

   They don't advertise. Just as Plato says in The Republic that the ideal
rulers are those who do not want to govern, the best fund managers often
behave as if they don't want your money. They don't appear constantly on
financial television or run ads boasting of their No. 1 returns. The steady lit-
tle Mairs & Power Growth Fund didn't even have a website until 2001 and
still sells its shares in only 24 states. The Torray Fund has never run a retail
advertisement since its launch in 1990.

   What else should you watch for? Most fund buyers look at past
performance first, then at the manager's reputation, then at the riski-
ness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund's expenses.8

   The intelligent investor looks at those same things--but in the oppo-
site order.

   Since a fund's expenses are far more predictable than its future risk
or return, you should make them your first filter. There's no good rea-
son ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses,
by fund category:

· Taxable and municipal bonds:  0.75%

· U.S. equities (large and mid-sized stocks): 1.0%

· High-yield ( junk) bonds:     1.0%

Level Analysis of the Mutual Fund Investment Decision," Journal of Finan-
cial Services Research, vol. 10, 1996, pp. 59­82; Investment Company

· U.S. equities (small stocks):  1.25%
· Foreign stocks:                1.50%9

   Next, evaluate risk. In its prospectus (or buyer's guide), every fund
must show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quar-
ter. If you can't stand losing at least that much money in three months,
go elsewhere. It's also worth checking a fund's Morningstar rating. A
leading investment research firm, Morningstar awards "star ratings" to
funds, based on how much risk they took to earn their returns (one
star is the worst, five is the best). But, just like past performance itself,
these ratings look back in time; they tell you which funds were the
best, not which are going to be. Five-star funds, in fact, have a discon-
certing habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first find
a low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be
different, don't hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to
shut down before they get too big for their britches. Then, and only
then, consult their Morningstar rating.10

   Finally, look at past performance, remembering that it is only a pale
predictor of future returns. As we've already seen, yesterday's winners
often become tomorrow's losers. But researchers have shown that
one thing is almost certain: Yesterday's losers almost never become
tomorrow's winners. So avoid funds with consistently poor past
returns--especially if they have above-average annual expenses.

THE CLOSED WORLD OF
CLOSED-END FUNDS

Closed-end stock funds, although popular during the 1980s, have
slowly atrophied. Today, there are only 30 diversified domestic

results, Morningstar is the single best source of information on funds for
individual investors.
Commentary on Chapter 9  253

equity funds, many of them tiny, trading only a few hundred shares
a day, with high expenses and weird strategies (like Morgan Fun-
Shares, which specializes in the stocks of "habit-forming" industries
like booze, casinos, and cigarettes). Research by closed-end fund
expert Donald Cassidy of Lipper Inc. reinforces Graham's earlier
observations: Diversified closed-end stock funds trading at a discount
not only tend to outperform those trading at a premium but are likely
to have a better return than the average open-end mutual fund.
Sadly, however, diversified closed-end stock funds are not always
available at a discount in what has become a dusty, dwindling
market.11

   But there are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially
strong choices available in the municipal-bond area. When these
funds trade at a discount, their yield is amplified and they can be
attractive, so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds
listed above.12

   The new breed of exchange-traded index funds can be worth
exploring as well. These low-cost "ETFs" sometimes offer the only
means by which an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market like,
say, companies based in Belgium or stocks in the semiconductor
industry. Other index ETFs offer much broader market exposure. How-
ever, they are generally not suitable for investors who wish to add
money regularly, since most brokers will charge a separate commis-
sion on every new investment you make.13

11 Unlike a mutual fund, a closed-end fund does not issue new shares
directly to anyone who wants to buy them. Instead, an investor must buy
shares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is willing
to part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates above and below
their net asset value, depending on supply and demand.

13 Unlike index mutual funds, index ETFs are subject to standard stock com-
missions when you buy and sell them--and these commissions are often
assessed on any additional purchases or reinvested dividends. Details are

254  Commentary on Chapter 9

KNOW WHEN TO FOLD 'EM

Once you own a fund, how can you tell when it's time to sell?
The standard advice is to ditch a fund if it underperforms the market
(or similar portfolios) for one--or is it two?--or is it three?--years in
a row. But this advice makes no sense. From its birth in 1970
through 1999, the Sequoia Fund underperformed the S & P 500
index in 12 out of its 29 years--or more than 41% of the time. Yet
Sequoia gained more than 12,500% over that period, versus 4,900%
for the index.14

   The performance of most funds falters simply because the type of
stocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. If you hired a manager
to invest in a particular way, why fire him for doing what he promised?
By selling when a style of investing is out of fashion, you not only lock
in a loss but lock yourself out of the all-but-inevitable recovery. One
study showed that mutual-fund investors underperformed their own
funds by 4.7 percentage points annually from 1998 through 2001--
simply by buying high and selling low.15

   So when should you sell? Here a few definite red flags:

· a sharp and unexpected change in strategy, such as a "value"
     fund loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a "growth" fund
     buying tons of insurance stocks in 2002;

· an increase in expenses, suggesting that the managers are lin-
     ing their own pockets;

· large and frequent tax bills generated by excessive trading;
· suddenly erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund

     generates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain).

14 See Sequoia's June 30, 1999, report to shareholders at www.sequoia
fund.com/Reports/Quarterly/SemiAnn99.htm. Sequoia has been closed to
new investors since 1982, which has reinforced its superb performance.

    WHY WE LOVE OUR OUIJA BOARDS

Believing--or even just hoping--that we can pick the best funds
of the future makes us feel better. It gives us the pleasing sensa-
tion that we are in charge of our own investment destiny. This
"I'm-in-control-here" feeling is part of the human condition; it's
what psychologists call overconfidence. Here are just a few
examples of how it works:

· In 1999, Money Magazine asked more than 500 people
   whether their portfolios had beaten the market. One in four
   said yes. When asked to specify their returns, however, 80%
   of those investors reported gains lower than the market's.
   (Four percent had no idea how much their portfolios rose--
   but were sure they had beaten the market anyway!)

· A Swedish study asked drivers who had been in severe car
   crashes to rate their own skills behind the wheel. These peo-
   ple--including some the police had found responsible for the
   accidents and others who had been so badly injured that
   they answered the survey from their hospital beds--insisted
   they were better-than-average drivers.

· In a poll taken in late 2000, Time and CNN asked more than
   1,000 likely voters whether they thought they were in the top
   1% of the population by income. Nineteen percent placed
   themselves among the richest 1% of Americans.

· In late 1997, a survey of 750 investors found that 74%
   believed their mutual-fund holdings would "consistently beat
   the Standard & Poor's 500 each year"--even though most
   funds fail to beat the S & P 500 in the long run and many fail
   to beat it in any year.1

   While this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psy-
che, that doesn't make it good investment policy. It makes sense
to believe you can predict something only if it actually is pre-
dictable. Unless you are realistic, your quest for self-esteem will
end up in self-defeat.

   As the investment consultant Charles Ellis puts it, "If you're not pre-
pared to stay married, you shouldn't get married." 16 Fund investing is
no different. If you're not prepared to stick with a fund through at least
three lean years, you shouldn't buy it in the first place. Patience is the
fund investor's single most powerful ally.

CHAPTER 10

The Investor and His Advisers

The investment of money in securities is unique among business

operations in that it is almost always based in some degree on
advice received from others. The great bulk of investors are ama-
teurs. Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can
profit by professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent
in the very concept of investment advice.

   If the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking
advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That
idea has some element of naïveté. Businessmen seek professional
advice on various elements of their business, but they do not
expect to be told how to make a profit. That is their own bailiwick.
When they, or nonbusiness people, rely on others to make invest-
ment profits for them, they are expecting a kind of result for which
there is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs.

   If we assume that there are normal or standard income results to
be obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the
adviser can be more readily established. He will use his superior
training and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and
to make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is
entitled. It is when the investor demands more than an average
return on his money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better
for him, that the question arises whether more is being asked or
promised than is likely to be delivered.

   Advice on investments may be obtained from a variety of
sources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowl-
edgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a broker-
age firm or investment banking house; (4) a financial service or

periodical; and (5) an investment counselor.* The miscellaneous
character of this list suggests that no logical or systematic approach
in this matter has crystallized, as yet, in the minds of investors.

   Certain common-sense considerations relate to the criterion of
normal or standard results mentioned above. Our basic thesis is
this: If the investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in han-
dling his funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers
strictly to standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of
investment, or he must have an unusually intimate and favorable
knowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other
channels. But if the ordinary business or professional relationship
exists between the investor and his advisers, he can be receptive to
less conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has
grown in knowledge and experience and has therefore become
competent to pass independent judgment on the recommendations
of others. He has then passed from the category of defensive or
unenterprising investor into that of aggressive or enterprising
investor.

Investment Counsel and Trust Services of Banks

   The truly professional investment advisers--that is, the well-
established investment counsel firms, who charge substantial
annual fees--are quite modest in their promises and pretentions.
For the most part they place their clients' funds in standard inter-
est- and dividend-paying securities, and they rely mainly on nor-
mal investment experience for their overall results. In the typical
case it is doubtful whether more than 10% of the total fund is ever
invested in securities other than those of leading companies, plus

* The list of sources for investment advice remains as "miscellaneous" as it
was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors conducted in late 2002 for
the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group, found that
17% of investors depended most heavily for investment advice on a spouse
or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a broker; 10% on financial periodicals;
and 24% on a financial planner. The only difference from Graham's day is
that 8% of investors now rely heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial
television. (See www.sia.com.)
The Investor and His Advisers  259

government bonds (including state and municipal issues); nor do
they make a serious effort to take advantage of swings in the gen-
eral market.

   The leading investment-counsel firms make no claim to being
brilliant; they do pride themselves on being careful, conservative,
and competent. Their primary aim is to conserve the principal
value over the years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate
of income. Any accomplishment beyond that--and they do strive
to better the goal--they regard in the nature of extra service ren-
dered. Perhaps their chief value to their clients lies in shielding
them from costly mistakes. They offer as much as the defensive
investor has the right to expect from any counselor serving the
general public.

   What we have said about the well-established investment-
counsel firms applies generally to the trust and advisory services of
the larger banks.*

Financial Services

   The so-called financial services are organizations that send out
uniform bulletins (sometimes in the form of telegrams) to their
subscribers. The subjects covered may include the state and
prospects of business, the behavior and prospect of the securities
markets, and information and advice regarding individual issues.
There is often an "inquiry department" which will answer que-
stons affecting an individual subscriber. The cost of the service
averages much less than the fee that investment counselors charge
their individual clients. Some organizations--notably Babson's
and Standard & Poor's--operate on separate levels as a financial
service and as investment counsel. (Incidentally, other organiza-

* The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has not
changed, but today they generally do not offer their services to investors
with less than $1 million in financial assets; in some cases, $5 million or
more is required. Today thousands of independent financial-planning firms
perform very similar functions, although (as analyst Robert Veres puts it) the
mutual fund has replaced blue-chip stocks as the investment of choice and
diversification has replaced "quality" as the standard of safety.
260  The Intelligent Investor

tions--such as Scudder, Stevens & Clark--operate separately as
investment counsel and as one or more investment funds.)

   The financial services direct themselves, on the whole, to a quite
different segment of the public than do the investment-counsel
firms. The latters' clients generally wish to be relieved of bother
and the need for making decisions. The financial services offer
information and guidance to those who are directing their own
financial affairs or are themselves advising others. Many of these
services confine themselves exclusively, or nearly so, to forecasting
market movements by various "technical" methods. We shall dis-
miss these with the observation that their work does not concern
"investors" as the term is used in this book.

   On the other hand, some of the best known--such as Moody's
Investment Service and Standard & Poor's--are identified with
statistical organizations that compile the voluminous statistical
data that form the basis for all serious security analysis. These ser-
vices have a varied clientele, ranging from the most conservative-
minded investor to the rankest speculator. As a result they must
find it difficult to adhere to any clear-cut or fundamental philoso-
phy in arriving at their opinions and recommendations.

   An old-established service of the type of Moody's and the others
must obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of
investors. What is it? Basically they address themselves to the mat-
ters in which the average active investor-speculator is interested,
and their views on these either command some measure of author-
ity or at least appear more reliable than those of the unaided client.

   For years the financial services have been making stock-market
forecasts without anyone taking this activity very seriously. Like
everyone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes
wrong. Wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid
the risk of being proved completely wrong. (There is a well-
developed art of Delphic phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to
whatever the future brings.) In our view--perhaps a prejudiced
one--this segment of their work has no real significance except for
the light it throws on human nature in the securities markets.
Nearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by
someone else what he thinks the market is going to do. The
demand being there, it must be supplied.

   Their interpretations and forecasts of business conditions, of
The Investor and His Advisers  261

course, are much more authoritative and informing. These are an
important part of the great body of economic intelligence which is
spread continuously among buyers and sellers of securities and
tends to create fairly rational prices for stocks and bonds under
most circumstances. Undoubtedly the material published by the
financial services adds to the store of information available and for-
tifies the investment judgment of their clients.

   It is difficult to evaluate their recommendations of individual
securities. Each service is entitled to be judged separately, and the
verdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive
study covering many years. In our own experience we have noted
among them a pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair
what could otherwise be more useful advisory work. This is their
general view that a stock should be bought if the near-term
prospects of the business are favorable and should be sold if these
are unfavorable--regardless of the current price. Such a superficial
principle often prevents the services from doing the sound analyti-
cal job of which their staffs are capable--namely, to ascertain
whether a given stock appears over- or undervalued at the current
price in the light of its indicated long-term future earning power.

   The intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on
the basis of recommendations received from a financial service. Once
this point is established, the role of the financial service then becomes
the useful one of supplying information and offering suggestions.

Advice from Brokerage Houses

   Probably the largest volume of information and advice to the
security-owning public comes from stockbrokers. These are mem-
bers of the New York Stock Exchange, and of other exchanges,
who execute buying and selling orders for a standard commission.
Practically all the houses that deal with the public maintain a
"statistical" or analytical department, which answers inquiries
and makes recommendations. A great deal of analytical literature,
some of it elaborate and expensive, is distributed gratis to the
firms' customers--more impressively referred to as clients.

   A great deal is at stake in the innocent-appearing question
whether "customers" or "clients" is the more appropriate name. A
business has customers; a professional person or organization has
262  The Intelligent Investor

clients. The Wall Street brokerage fraternity has probably the high-
est ethical standards of any business, but it is still feeling its way
toward the standards and standing of a true profession.*

   In the past Wall Street has thrived mainly on speculation, and
stock-market speculators as a class were almost certain to lose
money. Hence it has been logically impossible for brokerage
houses to operate on a thoroughly professional basis. To do that
would have required them to direct their efforts toward reducing
rather than increasing their business.

   The farthest that certain brokerage houses have gone in that
direction--and could have been expected to go--is to refrain from
inducing or encouraging anyone to speculate. Such houses have
confined themselves to executing orders given them, to supplying
financial information and analyses, and to rendering opinions on
the investment merits of securities. Thus, in theory at least, they are
devoid of all responsibility for either the profits or the losses of
their speculative customers.

   Most stock-exchange houses, however, still adhere to the old-
time slogans that they are in business to make commissions and
that the way to succeed in business is to give the customers what
they want. Since the most profitable customers want speculative
advice and suggestions, the thinking and activities of the typical
firm are pretty closely geared to day-to-day trading in the market.
Thus it tries hard to help its customers make money in a field
where they are condemned almost by mathematical law to lose in
the end. By this we mean that the speculative part of their opera-
tions cannot be profitable over the long run for most brokerage-

* Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall Street has
ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly cynical enough. Wall
Street may have higher ethical standards than some businesses (smug-
gling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and journalism come to mind)
but the investment world nevertheless has enough liars, cheaters, and
thieves to keep Satan's check-in clerks frantically busy for decades to come.
 The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the belief
that Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable advice have
learned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this point.
 Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham was directing
at full-service brokers, ended up applying to discount Internet brokers in the
The Investor and His Advisers  263

house customers. But to the extent that their operations resemble
true investing they may produce investment gains that more than
offset the speculative losses.

   The investor obtains advice and information from stock-
exchange houses through two types of employees, now known
officially as "customers' brokers" (or "account executives") and
financial analysts.

   The customer's broker, also called a "registered representative,"
formerly bore the less dignified title of "customer's man." Today
he is for the most part an individual of good character and consid-
erable knowledge of securities, who operates under a rigid code of
right conduct. Nevertheless, since his business is to earn commis-
sions, he can hardly avoid being speculation-minded. Thus the
security buyer who wants to avoid being influenced by speculative
considerations will ordinarily have to be careful and explicit in his
dealing with his customer's broker; he will have to show clearly, by
word and deed, that he is not interested in anything faintly resem-
bling a stock-market "tip." Once the customer's broker under-
stands clearly that he has a real investor on his hands, he will
respect this point of view and cooperate with it.

   The financial analyst, formerly known chiefly as security ana-
lyst, is a person of particular concern to the author, who has been
one himself for more than five decades and has helped educate
countless others. At this stage we refer only to the financial ana-
lysts employed by brokerage houses. The function of the security
analyst is clear enough from his title. It is he who works up the
detailed studies of individual securities, develops careful compar-
isons of various issues in the same field, and forms an expert opin-
ion of the safety or attractiveness or intrinsic value of all the
different kinds of stocks and bonds.

late 1990s. These firms spent millions of dollars on flashy advertising that
goaded their customers into trading more and trading faster. Most of those
customers ended up picking their own pockets, instead of paying someone
else to do it for them--and the cheap commissions on that kind of transac-
tion are a poor consolation for the result. More traditional brokerage firms,
meanwhile, began emphasizing financial planning and "integrated asset
management," instead of compensating their brokers only on the basis of
how many commissions they could generate.
264  The Intelligent Investor

   By what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal
requirements for being a security analyst. Contrast with this the
facts that a customer's broker must pass an examination, meet the
required character tests, and be duly accepted and registered by
the New York Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, nearly all the
younger analysts have had extensive business-school training, and
the oldsters have acquired at least the equivalent in the school of
long experience. In the great majority of cases, the employing bro-
kerage house can be counted on to assure itself of the qualifications
and competence of its analysts.*

   The customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security
analysts directly, or his contact may be an indirect one via the cus-
tomer's broker. In either case the analyst is available to the client
for a considerable amount of information and advice. Let us make
an emphatic statement here. The value of the security analyst to the
investor depends largely on the investor's own attitude. If the
investor asks the analyst the right questions, he is likely to get
the right--or at least valuable--answers. The analysts hired by
brokerage houses, we are convinced, are greatly handicapped by
the general feeling that they are supposed to be market analysts as
well. When they are asked whether a given common stock is
"sound," the question often means, "Is this stock likely to advance
during the next few months?" As a result many of them are com-

* This remains true, although many of Wall Street's best analysts hold the
title of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is awarded by the
Association of Investment Management & Research (formerly the Financial
Analysts Federation) only after the candidate has completed years of rigor-
ous study and passed a series of difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts
worldwide have been certified as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor
Stanley Block found that most CFAs ignore Graham's teachings: Growth
potential ranks higher than quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in
determining P/E ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on
recent price than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley
Block, "A Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory," Financial Ana-
lysts Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org. As Graham was
fond of saying, his own books have been read by--and ignored by--more
people than any other books in finance.
The Investor and His Advisers  265

pelled to analyze with one eye on the stock ticker--a pose not con-
ducive to sound thinking or worthwhile conclusions.*

   In the next section of this book we shall deal with some of the con-
cepts and possible achievements of security analysis. A great many
analysts working for stock exchange firms could be of prime assis-
tance to the bona fide investor who wants to be sure that he gets full
value for his money, and possibly a little more. As in the case of the
customers' brokers, what is needed at the beginning is a clear under-
standing by the analyst of the investor's attitude and objectives. Once
the analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is value-
minded rather than quotation-minded, there is an excellent chance
that his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit.

The CFA Certificate for Financial Analysts

   An important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional
standing and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of
chartered financial analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior
practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests
of fitness.1 The subjects covered include security analysis and port-
folio management. The analogy with the long-established profes-
sional title of certified public accountant (CPA) is evident and
intentional. This relatively new apparatus of recognition and con-
trol should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and
eventually to place their work on a truly professional basis.

* It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere commoners to
contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility of institutional investors
are permitted to approach the throne of the almighty Wall Street analyst. An indi-
vidual investor might, perhaps, have some luck calling analysts who work at
"regional" brokerage firms headquartered outside of New York City. The investor
relations area at the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a
list of analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and
www.multex.com offer access to analysts' research reports--but the intelligent
investor should remember that most analysts do not analyze businesses.
Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock prices.
 Benjamin Graham was the prime force behind the establishment of the CFA
program, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became a reality.

Dealings with Brokerage Houses

   One of the most disquieting developments of the period in
which we write this revision has been the financial embarrass-
ment--in plain words, bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy--of quite a
few New York Stock Exchange firms, including at least two of con-
siderable size.* This is the first time in half a century or more that
such a thing has happened, and it is startling for more than one
reason. For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been
moving in the direction of closer and stricter controls over the
operations and financial condition of its members--including min-
imum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides
this, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their
members by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally,
the stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable
conditions--namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum
commission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-
ited number of member firms.

   The first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969)
were attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was
claimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and
produced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should
be pointed out this was probably the first time in history that
important enterprises have gone broke because they had more
business than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures
increased, they were blamed chiefly on "the falling off in volume."
A strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the

* The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan
& Co. and Goodbody & Co. Du Pont (founded by the heirs to the chemical
fortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970 only after Texas entrepreneur
H. Ross Perot lent more than $50 million to the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-
largest brokerage firm in the United States, would have failed in late 1970
had Merrill Lynch not acquired it. Hayden, Stone & Co. would also have
gone under if it had not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven bro-
kerage firms went bust. The farcical story of Wall Street's frenzied over-
expansion in the late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks's The Go-Go
Years (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999).
The Investor and His Advisers  267

NYSE in 1970 totaled 2,937 million shares, the largest volume in its
history and well over twice as large as in any year before 1965.
During the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual
volume had averaged "only" 712 million shares--one quarter of
the 1970 figure--but the brokerage business had enjoyed the great-
est prosperity in its history. If, as it appears, the member firms as a
whole had allowed their overhead and other expenses to increase
at a rate that could not sustain even a mild reduction in volume
during part of a year, this does not speak well for either their busi-
ness acumen or their financial conservatism.

   A third explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out
of a mist of concealment, and we suspect that it is the most plausi-
ble and significant of the three. It seems that a good part of the cap-
ital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common
stocks owned by the individual partners. Some of these seem to
have been highly speculative and carried at inflated values. When
the market declined in 1969 the quotations of such securities fell
drastically and a substantial part of the capital of the firms van-
ished with them.2 In effect the partners were speculating with the
capital that was supposed to protect the customers against the
ordinary financial hazards of the brokerage business, in order to
make a double profit thereon. This was inexcusable; we refrain
from saying more.

   The investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating
his financial policies but also in the associated details. These
include the choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders. Up to
now it was sufficient to counsel our readers to deal only with a
member of the New York Stock Exchange, unless he had com-
pelling reasons to use a nonmember firm. Reluctantly, we must
add some further advice in this area. We think that people who do
not carry margin accounts--and in our vocabulary this means all
nonprofessional investors--should have the delivery and receipt of
their securities handled by their bank. When giving a buying order
to your brokers you can instruct them to deliver the securities
bought to your bank against payment therefor by the bank; con-
versely, when selling you can instruct your bank to deliver the
securities to the broker against payment of the proceeds. These ser-
vices will cost a little extra but they should be well worth the
expense in terms of safety and peace of mind. This advice may be
268  The Intelligent Investor

disregarded, as no longer called for, after the investor is sure that
all the problems of stock-exchange firms have been disposed of,
but not before.*

Investment Bankers

   The term "investment banker" is applied to a firm that engages
to an important extent in originating, underwriting, and selling
new issues of stocks and bonds. (To underwrite means to guaran-
tee to the issuing corporation, or other issuer, that the security will
be fully sold.) A number of the brokerage houses carry on a certain
amount of underwriting activity. Generally this is confined to par-
ticipating in underwriting groups formed by leading investment
bankers. There is an additional tendency for brokerage firms to
originate and sponsor a minor amount of new-issue financing, par-
ticularly in the form of smaller issues of common stocks when a
bull market is in full swing.

   Investment banking is perhaps the most respectable department
of the Wall Street community, because it is here that finance plays
its constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of
industry. In fact, much of the theoretical justification for maintain-
ing active stock markets, notwithstanding their frequent specula-
tive excesses, lies in the fact that organized security exchanges
facilitate the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks. If investors or
speculators could not expect to see a ready market for a new secu-
rity offered them, they might well refuse to buy it.

   The relationship between the investment banker and the

* Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted electronically, and
securities are no longer physically "delivered." Thanks to the establishment
of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970,
investors are generally assured of recovering their full account values if their
brokerage firm becomes insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consor-
tium of brokers; all the members agree to pool their assets to cover losses
incurred by the customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC's pro-
tection eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.
The Investor and His Advisers  269

investor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer.
For many years past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar
value has consisted of bond issues that were purchased in the main
by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. In
this business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd
and experienced buyers. Hence any recommendations made by the
investment bankers to these customers have had to pass careful
and skeptical scrutiny. Thus these transactions are almost always
effected on a businesslike footing.

   But a different situation obtains in a relationship between the
individual security buyer and the investment banking firms, includ-
ing the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is
frequently inexperienced and seldom shrewd. He is easily influ-
enced by what the salesman tells him, especially in the case of
common-stock issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying
is chiefly to make a quick profit. The effect of all this is that the
public investor's protection lies less in his own critical faculty than
in the scruples and ethics of the offering houses.3

   It is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting
firms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles
of adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust
himself to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this
point: "The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves
recurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the
sale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-
tion." Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed. As
already pointed out, the years 1960­61 and, again, 1968­69 were
marked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual-
ity, sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many
cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi-
manipulation. A number of the more important Wall Street houses
have participated to some degree in these less than creditable activ-
ities, which demonstrates that the familiar combination of greed,
folly, and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the financial
scene.

   The intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and rec-
ommendations received from investment banking houses, espe-
cially those known by him to have an excellent reputation; but he
will be sure to bring sound and independent judgment to bear
270  The Intelligent Investor

upon these suggestions--either his own, if he is competent, or that
of some other type of adviser.*

Other Advisers

   It is a good old custom, especially in the smaller towns, to con-
sult one's local banker about investments. A commercial banker
may not be a thoroughgoing expert on security values, but he is
experienced and conservative. He is especially useful to the
unskilled investor, who is often tempted to stray from the straight
and unexciting path of a defensive policy and needs the steadying
influence of a prudent mind. The more alert and aggressive
investor, seeking counsel in the selection of security bargains, will
not ordinarily find the commercial banker's viewpoint to be espe-
cially suited to his own objectives.

   We take a more critical attitude toward the widespread custom
of asking investment advice from relatives or friends. The inquirer
always thinks he has good reason for assuming that the person
consulted has superior knowledge or experience. Our own obser-
vation indicates that it is almost as difficult to select satisfactory lay
advisers as it is to select the proper securities unaided. Much bad
advice is given free.

Summary

   Investors who are prepared to pay a fee for the management of
their funds may wisely select some well-established and well-
recommended investment-counsel firm. Alternatively, they may
use the investment department of a large trust company or the
supervisory service supplied on a fee basis by a few of the leading
New York Stock Exchange houses. The results to be expected are in
no wise exceptional, but they are commensurate with those of the
average well-informed and cautious investor.

* Those who heeded Graham's advice would not have been suckered into
buying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.
 This traditional role of bankers has for the most part been supplanted by
accountants, lawyers, or financial planners.
The Investor and His Advisers  271

   Most security buyers obtain advice without paying for it specifi-
cally. It stands to reason, therefore, that in the majority of cases they
are not entitled to and should not expect better than average results.
They should be wary of all persons, whether customers' brokers or
security salesmen, who promise spectacular income or profits. This
applies both to the selection of securities and to guidance in the elu-
sive (and perhaps illusive) art of trading in the market.

   Defensive investors, as we have defined them, will not ordi-
narily be equipped to pass independent judgment on the security
recommendations made by their advisers. But they can be
explicit--and even repetitiously so--in stating the kind of securi-
ties they want to buy. If they follow our prescription they will con-
fine themselves to high-grade bonds and the common stocks of
leading corporations, preferably those that can be purchased at
individual price levels that are not high in the light of experience
and analysis. The security analyst of any reputable stock-exchange
house can make up a suitable list of such common stocks and can
certify to the investor whether or not the existing price level there-
for is a reasonably conservative one as judged by past experience.

   The aggressive investor will ordinarily work in active coopera-
tion with his advisers. He will want their recommendations
explained in detail, and he will insist on passing his own judgment
upon them. This means that the investor will gear his expectations
and the character of his security operations to the development of
his own knowledge and experience in the field. Only in the excep-
tional case, where the integrity and competence of the advisers
have been thoroughly demonstrated, should the investor act upon
the advice of others without understanding and approving the
decision made.

   There have always been unprincipled stock salesmen and fly-
by-night stock brokers, and--as a matter of course--we have
advised our readers to confine their dealings, if possible, to mem-
bers of the New York Stock Exchange. But we are reluctantly com-
pelled to add the extra-cautious counsel that security deliveries
and payments be made through the intermediary of the investor's
bank. The distressing Wall Street brokerage-house picture may
have cleared up completely in a few years, but in late 1971 we still
suggest, "Better safe than sorry."

DO YOU N E E D H E LP?

In the glory days of the late 1990s, many investors chose to go it alone.
By doing their own research, picking stocks themselves, and placing
their trades through an online broker, these investors bypassed Wall
Street's costly infrastructure of research, advice, and trading. Unfortu-
nately, many do-it-yourselfers asserted their independence right before
the worst bear market since the Great Depression--making them feel,
in the end, that they were fools for going it alone. That's not necessar-
ily true, of course; people who delegated every decision to a traditional
stockbroker lost money, too.

   But many investors do take comfort from the experience, judgment,
and second opinion that a good financial adviser can provide. Some
investors may need an outsider to show them what rate of return they
need to earn on their investments, or how much extra money they
need to save, in order to meet their financial goals. Others may simply
benefit from having someone else to blame when their investments go
down; that way, instead of beating yourself up in an agony of self-
doubt, you get to criticize someone who typically can defend him or
herself and encourage you at the same time. That may provide just the
psychological boost you need to keep investing steadily at a time

when other investors' hearts may fail them. All in all, just as there's no
reason you can't manage your own portfolio, so there's no shame in
seeking professional help in managing it.1

   How can you tell if you need a hand? Here are some signals:
   Big losses. If your portfolio lost more than 40% of its value from
the beginning of 2000 through the end of 2002, then you did even
worse than the dismal performance of the stock market itself. It hardly
matters whether you blew it by being lazy, reckless, or just unlucky;
after such a giant loss, your portfolio is crying out for help.
   Busted budgets. If you perennially struggle to make ends meet,
have no idea where your money goes, find it impossible to save on a
regular schedule, and chronically fail to pay your bills on time, then
your finances are out of control. An adviser can help you get a grip on
your money by designing a comprehensive financial plan that will out-
line how--and how much--you should spend, borrow, save, and invest.
   Chaotic portfolios. All too many investors thought they were diver-
sified in the late 1990s because they owned 39 "different" Internet
stocks, or seven "different" U.S. growth-stock funds. But that's like
thinking that an all-soprano chorus can handle singing "Old Man
River" better than a soprano soloist can. No matter how many sopra-
nos you add, that chorus will never be able to nail all those low notes
until some baritones join the group. Likewise, if all your holdings go up
and down together, you lack the investing harmony that true diversifi-
cation brings. A professional "asset-allocation" plan can help.
   Major changes. If you've become self-employed and need to set
up a retirement plan, your aging parents don't have their finances in
order, or college for your kids looks unaffordable, an adviser can not
only provide peace of mind but help you make genuine improvements
in the quality of your life. What's more, a qualified professional can
ensure that you benefit from and comply with the staggering complex-
ity of the tax laws and retirement rules.

Remember that financial con artists thrive by talking you into trusting
them and by talking you out of investigating them. Before you place

your financial future in the hands of an adviser, it's imperative that you
find someone who not only makes you comfortable but whose honesty
is beyond reproach. As Ronald Reagan used to say, "Trust, then ver-
ify." Start off by thinking of the handful of people you know best and
trust the most. Then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom they
trust and who, they feel, delivers good value for his fees. A vote of
confidence from someone you admire is a good start.2

   Once you have the name of the adviser and his firm, as well as his
specialty--is he a stockbroker? financial planner? accountant? insur-
ance agent?--you can begin your due diligence. Enter the name of the
adviser and his or her firm into an Internet search engine like Google
to see if anything comes up (watch for terms like "fine," "complaint,"
"lawsuit," "disciplinary action," or "suspension"). If the adviser is a
stockbroker or insurance agent, contact the office of your state's
securities commissioner (a convenient directory of online links is at
www.nasaa.org) to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer
complaints have been filed against the adviser.3 If you're considering
an accountant who also functions as a financial adviser, your state's
accounting regulators (whom you can find through the National Asso-
ciation of State Boards of Accountancy at www.nasba.org) will tell
you whether his or her record is clean.

   Financial planners (or their firms) must register with either the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or securities regulators in the
state where their practice is based. As part of that registration, the
adviser must file a two-part document called Form ADV. You should be
able to view and download it at www.advisorinfo.sec.gov, www.iard.
com, or the website of your state securities regulator. Pay special
attention to the Disclosure Reporting Pages, where the adviser must
disclose any disciplinary actions by regulators. (Because unscrupu-

2 If you're unable to get a referral from someone you trust, you may be able
to find a fee-only financial planner through www.napfa.org (or www.feeonly.
org), whose members are generally held to high standards of service and
integrity.
3 By itself, a customer complaint is not enough to disqualify an adviser from
your consideration; but a persistent pattern of complaints is. And a discipli-
nary action by state or Federal regulators usually tells you to find another
adviser. Another source for checking a broker's record is http://pdpi.nasdr.
com/PDPI.

lous advisers have been known to remove those pages before hand-
ing an ADV to a prospective client, you should independently obtain
your own complete copy.) It's a good idea to cross-check a financial
planner's record at www.cfp-board.org, since some planners who
have been disciplined outside their home state can fall through the reg-
ulatory cracks. For more tips on due diligence, see the sidebar below.

WORDS OF WARNING

The need for due diligence doesn't stop once you hire an
adviser. Melanie Senter Lubin, securities commissioner for the
State of Maryland, suggests being on guard for words and
phrases that can spell trouble. If your adviser keeps saying
them--or twisting your arm to do anything that makes you
uncomfortable--"then get in touch with the authorities very
quickly," warns Lubin. Here's the kind of lingo that should set off
warning bells:

"offshore"                "exclusive"

G ETTI NG TO KNOW YOU

A leading financial-planning newsletter recently canvassed dozens of
advisers to get their thoughts on how you should go about interview-
ing them.4 In screening an adviser, your goals should be to:

· determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just
     goes through the motions

· establish whether he or she understands the fundamental princi-
     ples of investing as they are outlined in this book

· assess whether he or she is sufficiently educated, trained, and
     experienced to help you.

   Here are some of the questions that prominent financial planners
recommended any prospective client should ask:

   Why are you in this business? What is the mission statement of your
firm? Besides your alarm clock, what makes you get up in the morning?

   What is your investing philosophy? Do you use stocks or mutual
funds? Do you use technical analysis? Do you use market timing? (A
"yes" to either of the last two questions is a "no" signal to you.)

   Do you focus solely on asset management, or do you also advise
on taxes, estate and retirement planning, budgeting and debt manage-
ment, and insurance? How do your education, experience, and cre-
dentials qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice? 5

   What needs do your clients typically have in common? How can
you help me achieve my goals? How will you track and report my
progress? Do you provide a checklist that I can use to monitor the
implementation of any financial plan we develop?

4 Robert Veres, editor and publisher of the Inside Information newsletter,
generously shared these responses for this book. Other checklists of ques-
tions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and www.napfa.org.
5 Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has taken
and passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other "alphabet soup"
of credentials brandished by financial planners, including the "CFM" or the
"CMFC," signify very little.) More important, by contacting the organization
that awards the credential, you can verify his record and check that he has
not been disciplined for violations of rules or ethics.
Commentary on Chapter 10  277

   How do you choose investments? What investing approach do you
believe is most successful, and what evidence can you show me that
you have achieved that kind of success for your clients? What do you
do when an investment performs poorly for an entire year? (Any
adviser who answers "sell" is not worth hiring.)

   Do you, when recommending investments, accept any form of com-
pensation from any third party? Why or why not? Under which circum-
stances? How much, in actual dollars, do you estimate I would pay for
your services the first year? What would make that number go up or
down over time? (If fees will consume more than 1% of your assets
annually, you should probably shop for another adviser.6)

   How many clients do you have, and how often do you communicate
with them? What has been your proudest achievement for a client?
What characteristics do your favorite clients share? What's the worst
experience you've had with a client, and how did you resolve it? What
determines whether a client speaks to you or to your support staff?
How long do clients typically stay with you?

   Can I see a sample account statement? (If you can't understand it,
ask the adviser to explain it. If you can't understand his explanation,
he's not right for you.)

   Do you consider yourself financially successful? Why? How do you
define financial success?

   How high an average annual return do you think is feasible on my
investments? (Anything over 8% to10% is unrealistic.)

   Will you provide me with your résumé, your Form ADV, and at least
three references? (If the adviser or his firm is required to file an ADV,
and he will not provide you a copy, get up and leave--and keep one
hand on your wallet as you go.)

   Have you ever had a formal complaint filed against you? Why did
the last client who fired you do so?

6 If you have less than $100,000 to invest, you may not be able to find a
financial adviser who will take your account. In that case, buy a diversified
basket of low-cost index funds, follow the behavioral advice throughout this
book, and your portfolio should eventually grow to the level at which you can
afford an adviser.
278  Commentary on Chapter 10

D E FEATI N G YOU R OWN WOR ST E N E MY

Finally, bear in mind that great financial advisers do not grow on trees.
Often, the best already have as many clients as they can handle--and
may be willing to take you on only if you seem like a good match. So
they will ask you some tough questions as well, which might include:

   Why do you feel you need a financial adviser?
   What are your long-term goals?
   What has been your greatest frustration in dealing with other advis-
ers (including yourself)?
   Do you have a budget? Do you live within your means? What per-
centage of your assets do you spend each year?
   When we look back a year from now, what will I need to have
accomplished in order for you to be happy with your progress?
   How do you handle conflicts or disagreements?
   How did you respond emotionally to the bear market that began in
2000?
   What are your worst financial fears? Your greatest financial hopes?
   What rate of return on your investments do you consider reason-
able? (Base your answer on Chapter 3.)

   An adviser who doesn't ask questions like these--and who does
not show enough interest in you to sense intuitively what other ques-
tions you consider to be the right ones--is not a good fit.

   Above all else, you should trust your adviser enough to permit him
or her to protect you from your worst enemy--yourself. "You hire an
adviser," explains commentator Nick Murray, "not to manage money
but to manage you."

   "If the adviser is a line of defense between you and your worst
impulsive tendencies," says financial-planning analyst Robert Veres,
"then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of
you control them." Among those systems:

· a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn,
     save, spend, borrow, and invest your money;

· an investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental
     approach to investing;

· an asset-allocation plan that details how much money you will
     keep in different investment categories.
Commentary on Chapter 10  279

   These are the building blocks on which good financial decisions
must be founded, and they should be created mutually--by you and
the adviser--rather than imposed unilaterally. You should not invest a
dollar or make a decision until you are satisfied that these foundations
are in place and in accordance with your wishes.

Security Analysis for the Lay Investor:

General Approach

Financial analysis is now a well-established and flourishing pro-

fession, or semiprofession. The various societies of analysts that
make up the National Federation of Financial Analysts have over
13,000 members, most of whom make their living out of this
branch of mental activity. Financial analysts have textbooks, a code
of ethics, and a quarterly journal.* They also have their share of
unresolved problems. In recent years there has been a tendency to
replace the general concept of "security analysis" by that of "finan-
cial analysis." The latter phrase has a broader implication and is
better suited to describe the work of most senior analysts on Wall
Street. It would be useful to think of security analysis as limiting
itself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and
bonds, whereas financial analysis would comprise that work, plus
the determination of investment policy (portfolio selection), plus a
substantial amount of general economic analysis.1 In this chapter
we shall use whatever designation is most applicable, with chief
emphasis on the work of the security analyst proper.

   The security analyst deals with the past, the present, and the
future of any given security issue. He describes the business; he
summarizes its operating results and financial position; he sets
forth its strong and weak points, its possibilities and risks; he esti-
mates its future earning power under various assumptions, or as a

* The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the Association for
Investment Management and Research; its "quarterly" research publication,
the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every other month.

Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  281

"best guess." He makes elaborate comparisons of various compa-
nies, or of the same company at various times. Finally, he expresses
an opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment-
grade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it
is a common stock.

   In doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a
number of techniques, ranging from the elementary to the most
abstruse. He may modify substantially the figures in the
company's annual statements, even though they bear the sacred
imprimatur of the certified public accountant. He is on the lookout
particularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal
more or less than they say.

   The security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by
which we can conclude whether a given bond or preferred stock
may be termed sound enough to justify purchase for investment.
These standards relate primarily to past average earnings, but they
are concerned also with capital structure, working capital, asset
values, and other matters.

   In dealing with common stocks the security analyst until
recently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined
as were his standards of safety for bonds and preferred stocks.
Most of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-
formances, a more or less general forecast of the future--with par-
ticular emphasis on the next 12 months--and a rather arbitrary
conclusion. The latter was, and still is, often drawn with one eye on
the stock ticker or the market charts. In the past few years, how-
ever, much attention has been given by practicing analysts to the
problem of valuing growth stocks. Many of these have sold at such
high prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec-
ommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur-
chase by fairly definite projections of expected earnings running
fairly far into the future. Certain mathematical techniques of a
rather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the
valuations arrived at.

   We shall deal with these techniques, in foreshortened form, a lit-
tle later. However, we must point out a troublesome paradox here,
which is that the mathematical valuations have become most
prevalent precisely in those areas where one might consider them
least reliable. For the more dependent the valuation becomes on
282  The Intelligent Investor

anticipations of the future--and the less it is tied to a figure
demonstrated by past performance--the more vulnerable it
becomes to possible miscalculation and serious error. A large part
of the value found for a high-multiplier growth stock is derived
from future projections which differ markedly from past perfor-
mance--except perhaps in the growth rate itself. Thus it may be
said that security analysts today find themselves compelled to
become most mathematical and "scientific" in the very situations
which lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment.*

   Let us proceed, nonetheless, with our discussion of the more
important elements and techniques of security analysis. The pres-
ent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non-
professional investor. At the minimum he should understand what
the security analyst is talking about and driving at; beyond that, he
should be equipped, if possible, to distinguish between superficial
and sound analysis.

   Security analysis for the lay investor is thought of as beginning

* The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future period
over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast becomes to the
slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a company earning $1 per
share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the next 15 years, its earnings
would end up at $8.14. If the market values the company at 35 times earn-
ings, the stock would finish the period at roughly $285. But if earnings grow
at 14% instead of 15%, the company would earn $7.14 at the end of the
period--and, in the shock of that shortfall, investors would no longer be will-
ing to pay 35 times earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would
end up around $140 per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced
mathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process
of foreseeing the future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who
claims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems.
As Graham put it: "In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have
never seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or
related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you
could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute
theory for experience, and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive
guise of investment." (See p. 570.)
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  283

with the interpretation of a company's annual financial report. This
is a subject which we have covered for laymen in a separate book,
entitled The Interpretation of Financial Statements.2 We do not con-
sider it necessary or appropriate to traverse the same ground in
this chapter, especially since the emphasis in the present book is on
principles and attitudes rather than on information and descrip-
tion. Let us pass on to two basic questions underlying the selection
of investments. What are the primary tests of safety of a corporate
bond or preferred stock? What are the chief factors entering into
the valuation of a common stock?

Bond Analysis

   The most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of
security analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of bond
issues and investment-grade preferred stocks. The chief criterion
used for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest
charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in
the past. In the case of preferred stocks, it is the number of times
that bond interest and preferred dividends combined have been
covered.

   The exact standards applied will vary with different authorities.
Since the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determine
precisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-
book, Security Analysis, we recommend certain "coverage" stan-
dards, which appear in Table 11-1.*

   Our basic test is applied only to the average results for a period
of years. Other authorities require also that a minimum coverage be
shown for every year considered. We approve a "poorest-year" test

* In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to assemble
his or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds invest in corporate
bonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified bundle of securities. Since it is
not feasible to build a diversified bond portfolio on your own unless you
have at least $100,000, the typical intelligent investor will be best off simply
buying a low-cost bond fund and leaving the painstaking labor of credit
research to its managers. For more on bond funds, see the commentary on
Chapter 4.

B. For Investment-grade Preferred Stocks

  The same minimum figures as above are required to be shown by the
  ratio of earnings before income taxes to the sum of fixed charges plus
  twice preferred dividends.

  NOTE: The inclusion of twice the preferred dividends allows for the fact
           that preferred dividends are not income-tax deductible, whereas
           interest charges are so deductible.

C. Other Categories of Bonds and Preferreds

as an alternative to the seven-year-average test; it would be suffi-
cient if the bond or preferred stock met either of these criteria.

   It may be objected that the large increase in bond interest rates
since 1961 would justify some offsetting reduction in the coverage
of charges required. Obviously it would be much harder for an
industrial company to show a seven-times coverage of interest
charges at 8% than at 41/2%. To meet this changed situation we now
suggest an alternative requirement related to the percent earned on
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  285

the principal amount of the debt. These figures might be 33% before
taxes for an industrial company, 20% for a public utility, and 25%
for a railroad. It should be borne in mind here that the rate actually
paid by most companies on their total debt is considerably less
than the current 8% figures, since they have the benefit of older
issues bearing lower coupons. The "poorest year" requirement
could be set at about two-thirds of the seven-year requirement.

   In addition to the earnings-coverage test, a number of others are
generally applied. These include the following:

   1. Size of Enterprise. There is a minimum standard in terms of
volume of business for a corporation--varying as between indus-
trials, utilities, and railroads--and of population for a municipality.

   2. Stock/Equity Ratio. This is the ratio of the market price of the
junior stock issues* to the total face amount of the debt, or the debt
plus preferred stock. It is a rough measure of the protection, or "cush-
ion," afforded by the presence of a junior investment that must first
bear the brunt of unfavorable developments. This factor includes the
market's appraisal of the future prospects of the enterprise.

   3. Property Value. The asset values, as shown on the balance sheet
or as appraised, were formerly considered the chief security and
protection for a bond issue. Experience has shown that in most
cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the
assets lose most of their reputed value. Asset values, however,
retain importance as a separate test of ample security for bonds
and preferred stocks in three enterprise groups: public utilities
(because rates may depend largely on the property investment),
real-estate concerns, and investment companies.

   At this point the alert investor should ask, "How dependable are
tests of safety that are measured by past and present performance,
in view of the fact that payment of interest and principal depends
upon what the future will bring forth?" The answer can be founded

* By "junior stock issues" Graham means shares of common stock. Pre-
ferred stock is considered "senior" to common stock because the company
must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any dividends on the
common.
286  The Intelligent Investor

only on experience. Investment history shows that bonds and pre-
ferred stocks that have met stringent tests of safety, based on the
past, have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi-
tudes of the future successfully. This has been strikingly demon-
strated in the major field of railroad bonds--a field that has been
marked by a calamitous frequency of bankruptcies and serious
losses. In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long
been overbonded, had shown an inadequate coverage of fixed
charges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been
ruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,
practically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial
embarrassment. Our premise was strikingly vindicated by the
financial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s
and in 1950. All of these, with one exception, started their careers
with fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of
fixed-interest requirements was ample, or at least respectable. The
exception was the New Haven Railroad, which in its reorganization
year, 1947, earned its new charges only about 1.1 times. In conse-
quence, while all the other roads were able to come through rather
difficult times with solvency unimpaired, the New Haven relapsed
into trusteeship (for the third time) in 1961.

   In Chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank-
ruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad, which shook the financial
community in 1970. An elementary fact in this case was that the
coverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as
early as 1965; hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided
or disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan-
cial collapse.

   Our observations on the adequacy of the past record to judge
future safety apply, and to an even greater degree, to the public
utilities, which constitute a major area for bond investment.
Receivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or
system is almost impossible. Since Securities and Exchange Com-
mission control was instituted,* along with the breakup of most of

* After investors lost billions of dollars on the shares of recklessly assem-
bled utility companies in 1929­1932, Congress authorized the SEC to reg-
ulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  287

the holding-company systems, public-utility financing has been
sound and bankruptcies unknown. The financial troubles of elec-
tric and gas utilities in the 1930s were traceable almost 100% to
financial excesses and mismanagement, which left their imprint
clearly on the companies' capitalization structures. Simple but
stringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the investor
away from the issues that were later to default.

   Among industrial bond issues the long-term record has been
different. Although the industrial group as a whole has shown a
better growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util-
ities, it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ-
ual companies and lines of business. Thus in the past, at least, there
have been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus-
trial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of
major size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a
serious depression.

   Few defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950, but
this fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression
during this long period. Since 1966 there have been adverse devel-
opments in the financial position of many industrial companies.
Considerable difficulties have developed as the result of unwise
expansion. On the one hand this has involved large additions to
both bank loans and long-term debt; on the other it has frequently
produced operating losses instead of the expected profits. At the
beginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the
interest payments of all nonfinancial firms had grown from $9.8
billion in 1963 to $26.1 billion in 1970, and that interest payments
had taken 29% of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in
1971, against only 16% in 1963.3 Obviously, the burden on many
individual firms had increased much more than this. Overbonded
companies have become all too familiar. There is every reason to
repeat the caution expressed in our 1965 edition:

    We are not quite ready to suggest that the investor may count
on an indefinite continuance of this favorable situation, and hence
relax his standards of bond selection in the industrial or any other
group.

Common-Stock Analysis

   The ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of
the issue which can be compared with the current price to deter-
mine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase. This val-
uation, in turn, would ordinarily be found by estimating the
average earnings over a period of years in the future and then mul-
tiplying that estimate by an appropriate "capitalization factor."

   The now-standard procedure for estimating future earning
power starts with average past data for physical volume, prices
received, and operating margin. Future sales in dollars are then
projected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in
volume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in
turn, are grounded first on general economic forecasts of gross
national product, and then on special calculations applicable to the
industry and company in question.

   An illustration of this method of valuation may be taken from
our 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel. The
Value Line, a leading investment service, makes forecasts of future
earnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above, and then
derives a figure of "price potentiality" (or projected market value)
by applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer-
tain past relationships. In Table 11-2 we reproduce the projections
for 1967­1969 made in June 1964, and compare them with the earn-
ings, and average market price actually realized in 1968 (which
approximates the 1967­1969 period).

   The combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side,
but not seriously so. The corresponding predictions made six years
before had turned out to be overoptimistic on earnings and divi-
dends; but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier, with the
result that the "price potentiality" figure proved to be about the
same as the actual average price for 1963.

   The reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore-
casts were wide of the mark. This is an instance in support of our
general view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a
good deal more dependable than those for individual companies.
Ideally, perhaps, the security analyst should pick out the three or
four companies whose future he thinks he knows the best, and con-
centrate his own and his clients' interest on what he forecasts for

them. Unfortunately, it appears to be almost impossible to distin-
guish in advance between those individual forecasts which can be
relied upon and those which are subject to a large chance of error.
At bottom, this is the reason for the wide diversification practiced
by the investment funds. For it is undoubtedly better to concen-
trate on one stock that you know is going to prove highly profitable,
rather than dilute your results to a mediocre figure, merely for
diversification's sake. But this is not done, because it cannot be
done dependably.4 The prevalence of wide diversification is in itself
a pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of "selectivity," to which Wall
Street constantly pays lip service.*

Factors Affecting the Capitalization Rate

   Though average future earnings are supposed to be the chief
determinant of value, the security analyst takes into account a
number of other factors of a more or less definite nature. Most of
these will enter into his capitalization rate, which can vary over a
wide range, depending upon the "quality" of the stock issue. Thus,
although two companies may have the same figure of expected

* In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically mimicked
the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, lest any different holdings cause
their returns to deviate from that of the index. In a countertrend, some fund
companies have launched what they call "focused" portfolios, which own 25
to 50 stocks that the managers declare to be their "best ideas." That leaves
investors wondering whether the other funds run by the same managers
contain their worst ideas. Considering that most of the "best idea" funds do
not markedly outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder
whether the managers' ideas are even worth having in the first place. For
indisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification would
be foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a few great
ideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual investor, not diversifying
is foolish, since it is so difficult to select a limited number of stocks that will
include most winners and exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the
damage any single loser can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all
the big winners will rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock
market index fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  291

earnings per share in 1973­1975--say $4--the analyst may value
one as low as 40 and the other as high as 100. Let us deal briefly
with some of the considerations that enter into these divergent
multipliers.

   1. General Long-Term Prospects. No one really knows anything
about what will happen in the distant future, but analysts and
investors have strong views on the subject just the same. These
views are reflected in the substantial differentials between the
price/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industry
groups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:

    For example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the
DJIA were selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil
companies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the
former than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are
often soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor-
mance they are as likely to be wrong as right.

   We shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material
on the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their
earnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-
nies, despite their high multipliers, made practically no gain in
earnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-
ter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in
their 1963 multipliers.5 Thus our chemical-stock example proved to
be one of the cases in which the market multipliers were proven
wrong.*

* Graham's point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to
nearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall Street's consensus
view of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too
pessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its most cheery just when the
stocks are most overpriced--and gloomiest just when they are cheapest.
The most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications
stocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999
and early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002. History proves
that Wall Street's "expert" forecasters are equally inept at predicting the

   2. Management. On Wall Street a great deal is constantly said on
this subject, but little that is really helpful. Until objective, quantita-
tive, and reasonably reliable tests of managerial competence are
devised and applied, this factor will continue to be looked at
through a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful
company has unusually good management. This will have shown
itself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-
mates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-
cussed factor of long-term prospects. The tendency to count it still
another time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to
expensive overvaluations. The management factor is most useful,
we think, in those cases in which a recent change has taken place
that has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual
figures.

   Two spectacular occurrences of this kind were associated with
the Chrysler Motor Corporation. The first took place as far back as
1921, when Walter Chrysler took command of the almost mori-
bund Maxwell Motors, and in a few years made it a large and
highly profitable enterprise, while numerous other automobile
companies were forced out of business. The second happened as
recently as 1962, when Chrysler had fallen far from its once high
estate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.
Then new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over
the reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per
share to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low
of 381/2 in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6

   3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure. Stock of a company
with a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead of the common is
clearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with
the same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi-
ties. Such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by
security analysts. A modest amount of bonds or preferred stock,

performance of 1) the market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) spe-
cific stocks. As Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do
any better are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions
that are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody's forecasts, including
his or her own. (See Chapter 8.)
294  The Intelligent Investor

however, is not necessarily a disadvantage to the common, nor is
the moderate use of seasonal bank credit. (Incidentally, a top-heavy
structure--too little common stock in relation to bonds and pre-
ferred--may under favorable conditions make for a huge specula-
tive profit in the common. This is the factor known as "leverage.")

   4. Dividend Record. One of the most persuasive tests of high qual-
ity is an uninterrupted record of dividend payments going back
over many years. We think that a record of continuous dividend
payments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor
in the company's quality rating. Indeed the defensive investor
might be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this
test.

   5. Current Dividend Rate. This, our last additional factor, is the
most difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,
the majority of companies have come to follow what may be called
a standard dividend policy. This has meant the distribution of
about two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent
period of high profits and inflationary demands for more capital
the figure has tended to be lower. (In 1969 it was 59.5% for the
stocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-
rations.)* Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the
earnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-
stantially affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary
company with expected average earnings of $3 and an expected
dividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18
times its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.

   However, an increasing number of growth companies are
departing from the once standard policy of paying out 60% or
more of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-

* This figure, now known as the "dividend payout ratio," has dropped consid-
erably since Graham's day as American tax law discouraged investors from
seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of year-end 2002, the
payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S & P 500-stock index and, as recently
as April 2000, it hit an all-time low of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/
research/fundamentals.asp.) We discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in
the commentary on Chapter 19.
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  295

ers' interests will be better served by retaining nearly all the profits
to finance expansion. The issue presents problems and requires
careful distinctions. We have decided to defer our discussion of the
vital question of proper dividend policy to a later section--Chapter
19--where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of
management-shareholder relations.

Capitalization Rates for Growth Stocks

   Most of the writing of security analysts on formal appraisals
relates to the valuation of growth stocks. Our study of the various
methods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple
formula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to
produce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more
refined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:

          Value = Current (Normal) Earnings  (8.5 plus twice
                       the expected annual growth rate)

The growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to
ten years.7

   In Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various
rates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-
tion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-
rent market price, assuming our formula is valid. In our last
edition we made that calculation for the DJIA and for six important
stock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-
mented at the time:

        The difference between the implicit 32.4% annual growth rate
    for Xerox and the extremely modest 2.8% for General Motors is
    indeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market's feel-
    ing that General Motors' 1963 earnings--the largest for any corpo-
    ration in history--can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded
    only modestly at best. The price earnings ratio of Xerox, on the
    other hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-
    tened upon a company of great achievement and perhaps still
    greater promise.

pares with an actual annual increase of 3.4% (compounded)
between 1951­1953 and 1961­1963.

   We should have added a caution somewhat as follows: The val-
uations of expected high-growth stocks are necessarily on the low
side, if we were to assume these growth rates will actually be real-
ized. In fact, according to the arithmetic, if a company could be
assumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitely in the future its
value would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for
the shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-
duce a margin of safety into his calculations--somewhat as an engi-
neer does in his specifications for a structure. On this basis the
purchases would realize his assigned objective (in 1963, a future
overall return of 71/2% per annum) even if the growth rate actually
realized proved substantially less than that projected in the for-
mula. Of course, then, if that rate were actually realized the
investor would be sure to enjoy a handsome additional return.
There is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with
an expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in which the analyst
can make realistic assumptions of both the proper multiplier for
the current earnings and the expectable multiplier for the future
earnings.

   As it happened the actual growth for Xerox and IBM proved
very close to the high rates implied from our formula. As just
explained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance
in the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIA itself was also
about as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-
ate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox
and IBM. It turned out that the 23% price rise to the end of 1970,
plus the 28% in aggregate dividend return received, gave not far
from the 71/2% annual overall gain posited in our formula. In the
case of the other four companies it may suffice to say that their
growth did not equal the expectations implied in the 1963 price
and that their quotations failed to rise as much as the DJIA. Warn-
ing: This material is supplied for illustrative purposes only, and
because of the inescapable necessity in security analysis to project
the future growth rate for most companies studied. Let the reader
not be misled into thinking that such projections have any high
degree of reliability or, conversely, that future prices can be
298  The Intelligent Investor

counted on to behave accordingly as the prophecies are realized,
surpassed, or disappointed.

   We should point out that any "scientific," or at least reasonably
dependable, stock evaluation based on anticipated future results
must take future interest rates into account. A given schedule of
expected earnings, or dividends, would have a smaller present
value if we assume a higher than if we assume a lower interest
structure.* Such assumptions have always been difficult to make
with any degree of confidence, and the recent violent swings in
long-term interest rates render forecasts of this sort almost pre-
sumptuous. Hence we have retained our old formula above, sim-
ply because no new one would appear more plausible.

Industry Analysis

   Because the general prospects of the enterprise carry major
weight in the establishment of market prices, it is natural for the
security analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic
position of the industry and of the individual company in its
industry. Studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail. They are
sometimes productive of valuable insights into important factors
that will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci-
ated by the current market. Where a conclusion of that kind can be
drawn with a fair degree of confidence, it affords a sound basis for
investment decisions.

   Our own observation, however, leads us to minimize some-
what the practical value of most of the industry studies that are
made available to investors. The material developed is ordinarily
of a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that
has already exerted considerable influence on market quotations.

* Why is this? By "the rule of 72," at 10% interest a given amount of money
doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in just over 10 years.
When interest rates are high, the amount of money you need to set aside
today to reach a given value in the future is lower--since those high interest
rates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates
today makes a future stream of earnings or dividends less valuable--since
the alternative of investing in bonds has become relatively more attractive.
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  299

Rarely does one find a brokerage-house study that points out,
with a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-
ing for a fall or that an unpopular one is due to prosper. Wall
Street's view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and this
necessarily applies to that important part of its investigations
which is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in
various industries.

   We must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive
growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on
the attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than in
the past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the
coming decade may depend on its relation to new products and
new processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study and
evaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for
effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with
research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his
own. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions
derived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-
ported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhaps
equal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober
calculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it
both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits that
are the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he
must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he
can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premium
for possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-
pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.

A Two-Part Appraisal Process

   Let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal
of a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. A
great deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that
this better be done quite differently than is now the established
practice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the
"past-performance value," which is based solely on the past
record. This would indicate what the stock would be worth--
absolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIA or of the S & P compos-
ite--if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue
300  The Intelligent Investor

unchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-
ative growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-
tinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be
carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-
ual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,
and also for current financial condition. The second part of the
analysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on
past performance should be modified because of new conditions
expected in the future.

   Such a procedure would divide the work between senior and
junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the
formula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-
performance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up such
factors for the designated companies--pretty much in mechanical
fashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to what
extent a company's performance--absolute or relative--is likely to
differ from its past record, and what change should be made in
the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the
senior analyst's report showed both the original valuation and the
modified one, with his reasons for the change.

   Is a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-
tive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.
We doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently
dependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or
small. We shall illustrate the difficulties of this job in our discus-
sion of Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in the next
chapter. Nonetheless it should be done for such common stocks.
Why? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or
projected valuations, as part of their daily work. The method we
propose should be an improvement on those generally followed
today. Secondly, because it should give useful experience and
insight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because
work of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded
experience--as has long been the case in medicine--that may lead
to better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-
sibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might well
prove an important area in which this approach will show real
pragmatic value. Eventually the intelligent analyst will confine
himself to those groups in which the future appears reasonably
Security Analysis for the Lay Investor  301

predictable,* or where the margin of safety of past-performance
value over current price is so large that he can take his chances on
future variations--as he does in selecting well-secured senior secu-
rities.

   In subsequent chapters we shall supply concrete examples of
the application of analytical techniques. But they will only be illus-
trations. If the reader finds the subject interesting he should pursue
it systematically and thoroughly before he considers himself quali-
fied to pass a final buy-or-sell judgment of his own on a security
issue.

* These industry groups, ideally, would not be overly dependent on such
unforeseeable factors as fluctuating interest rates or the future direction of
prices for raw materials like oil or metals. Possibilities might be industries
like gaming, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, nursing homes, or waste man-
agement.

Putting a Price on the Future
Which factors determine how much you should be willing to pay for a
stock? What makes one company worth 10 times earnings and
another worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are
not overpaying for an apparently rosy future that turns out to be a
murky nightmare?

   Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:

· the company's "general long-term prospects"
· the quality of its management
· its financial strength and capital structure
· its dividend record
· and its current dividend rate.

   Let's look at these factors in the light of today's market.
   The long-term prospects. Nowadays, the intelligent investor
should begin by downloading at least five years' worth of annual
reports (Form 10-K) from the company's website or from the EDGAR

ual bonds, we will limit this discussion to stock analysis. For more on bond

database at www.sec.gov.2 Then comb through the financial state-
ments, gathering evidence to help you answer two overriding ques-
tions. What makes this company grow? Where do (and where will) its
profits come from? Among the problems to watch for:

· The company is a "serial acquirer." An average of more than two
     or three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all,
     if the company itself would rather buy the stock of other busi-
     nesses than invest in its own, shouldn't you take the hint and look
     elsewhere too? And check the company's track record as an
     acquirer. Watch out for corporate bulimics--firms that wolf down
     big acquisitions, only to end up vomiting them back out. Lucent,
     Mattel, Quaker Oats, and Tyco International are among the com-
     panies that have had to disgorge acquisitions at sickening losses.
     Other firms take chronic write-offs, or accounting charges proving
     that they overpaid for their past acquisitions. That's a bad omen
     for future deal making.3

· The company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or selling stock
     to raise boatloads of Other People's Money. These fat infusions of
     OPM are labeled "cash from financing activities" on the statement
     of cash flows in the annual report. They can make a sick company
     appear to be growing even if its underlying businesses are not
     generating enough cash--as Global Crossing and WorldCom
     showed not long ago.4

2 You should also get at least one year's worth of quarterly reports (on Form
10-Q). By definition, we are assuming that you are an "enterprising" investor
willing to devote a considerable amount of effort to your portfolio. If the
steps in this chapter sound like too much work to you, then you are not tem-
peramentally well suited to picking your own stocks. You cannot reliably
obtain the results you imagine unless you put in the kind of effort we
describe.
3 You can usually find details on acquisitions in the "Management's Discus-
sion and Analysis" section of Form 10-K; cross-check it against the foot-
notes to the financial statements. For more on "serial acquirers," see the
commentary on Chapter 12.
4 To determine whether a company is an OPM addict, read the "Statement
of Cash Flows" in the financial statements. This page breaks down the

· The company is a Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer (or
     a handful) for most of its revenues. In October 1999, fiber-optics
     maker Sycamore Networks, Inc. sold stock to the public for the
     first time. The prospectus revealed that one customer, Williams
     Communications, accounted for 100% of Sycamore's $11 million
     in total revenues. Traders blithely valued Sycamore's shares at
     $15 billion. Unfortunately, Williams went bankrupt just over two
     years later. Although Sycamore picked up other customers, its
     stock lost 97% between 2000 and 2002.

   As you study the sources of growth and profit, stay on the lookout
for positives as well as negatives. Among the good signs:

· The company has a wide "moat," or competitive advantage. Like
     castles, some companies can easily be stormed by marauding
     competitors, while others are almost impregnable. Several forces
     can widen a company's moat: a strong brand identity (think of
     Harley Davidson, whose buyers tattoo the company's logo onto
     their bodies); a monopoly or near-monopoly on the market;
     economies of scale, or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods
     or services cheaply (consider Gillette, which churns out razor
     blades by the billion); a unique intangible asset (think of Coca-
     Cola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical
     value but maintains a priceless hold on consumers); a resistance
     to substitution (most businesses have no alternative to electricity,
     so utility companies are unlikely to be supplanted any time soon).5

company's cash inflows and outflows into "operating activities," "invest-
ing activities," and "financing activities." If cash from operating activities is
consistently negative, while cash from financing activities is consistently
positive, the company has a habit of craving more cash than its own
businesses can produce--and you should not join the "enablers" of that
habitual abuse. For more on Global Crossing, see the commentary on
Chapter 12. For more on WorldCom, see the sidebar in the commentary on
Chapter 6.
5 For more insight into "moats," see the classic book Competitive Strategy
by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter (Free Press, New
York, 1998).
Commentary on Chapter 11  305

· The company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. By looking back at
     the income statements, you can see whether revenues and net
     earnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10
     years. A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal confirmed
     what other studies (and the sad experience of many investors)
     have shown: that the fastest-growing companies tend to overheat
     and flame out.6 If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10%
     pretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the
     15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is
     delusional. And an even higher rate--or a sudden burst of growth
     in one or two years--is all but certain to fade, just like an inexperi-
     enced marathoner who tries to run the whole race as if it were a
     100-meter dash.

· The company sows and reaps. No matter how good its products
     or how powerful its brands, a company must spend some money
     to develop new business. While research and development
     spending is not a source of growth today, it may well be tomor-
     row--particularly if a firm has a proven record of rejuvenating its
     businesses with new ideas and equipment. The average budget
     for research and development varies across industries and com-
     panies. In 2002, Procter & Gamble spent about 4% of its net
     sales on R & D, while 3M spent 6.5% and Johnson & Johnson
     10.9%. In the long run, a company that spends nothing on R & D
     is at least as vulnerable as one that spends too much.

   The quality and conduct of management. A company's execu-
tives should say what they will do, then do what they said. Read the
past annual reports to see what forecasts the managers made and
if they fulfilled them or fell short. Managers should forthrightly admit
their failures and take responsibility for them, rather than blaming
all-purpose scapegoats like "the economy," "uncertainty," or "weak
demand." Check whether the tone and substance of the chairman's
letter stay constant, or fluctuate with the latest fads on Wall Street.

a cement or underwear company suddenly declare that they were "on
the leading edge of the transformative software revolution"?)

   These questions can also help you determine whether the people
who run the company will act in the interests of the people who own
the company:

· Are they looking out for No. 1?
         A firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a

     very good reason. (Perhaps he discovered--and patented--the Foun-
     tain of Youth? Or found El Dorado and bought it for $1 an acre? Or
     contacted life on another planet and negotiated a contract obligat-
     ing the aliens to buy all their supplies from only one company on
     Earth?) Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests
     that the firm is run by the managers, for the managers.

         If a company reprices (or "reissues" or "exchanges") its stock
     options for insiders, stay away. In this switcheroo, a company can-
     cels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employees
     and executives, then replaces them with new ones at advanta-
     geous prices. If their value is never allowed to go to zero, while
     their potential profit is always infinite, how can options encourage
     good stewardship of corporate assets? Any established company
     that reprices options--as dozens of high-tech firms have--is a dis-
     grace. And any investor who buys stock in such a company is a
     sheep begging to be sheared.

         By looking in the annual report for the mandatory footnote
     about stock options, you can see how large the "option overhang"
     is. AOL Time Warner, for example, reported in the front of its
     annual report that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock out-
     standing as of December 31, 2002--but a footnote in the bowels
     of the report reveals that the company had issued options on 657
     million more shares. So AOL's future earnings will have to be
     divided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the poten-
     tial flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimate
     a company's future value.7

     gov, shows whether a firm's senior executives and directors have
     been buying or selling shares. There can be legitimate reasons for
     an insider to sell--diversification, a bigger house, a divorce settle-
     ment--but repeated big sales are a bright red flag. A manager
     can't legitimately be your partner if he keeps selling while you're
     buying.
· Are they managers or promoters?

         Executives should spend most of their time managing their
     company in private, not promoting it to the investing public. All too
     often, CEOs complain that their stock is undervalued no matter
     how high it goes--forgetting Graham's insistence that managers
     should try to keep the stock price from going either too low or too
     high.8 Meanwhile, all too many chief financial officers give "earn-
     ings guidance," or guesstimates of the company's quarterly prof-
     its. And some firms are hype-o-chondriacs, constantly spewing
     forth press releases boasting of temporary, trivial, or hypothetical
     "opportunities."

         A handful of companies--including Coca-Cola, Gillette, and
     USA Interactive--have begun to "just say no" to Wall Street's
     short-term thinking. These few brave outfits are providing more
     detail about their current budgets and long-term plans, while
     refusing to speculate about what the next 90 days might hold.
     (For a model of how a company can communicate candidly and
     fairly with its shareholders, go to the EDGAR database at
     www.sec.gov and view the 8-K filings made by Expeditors In-
     ternational of Washington, which periodically posts its superb
     question-and-answer dialogues with shareholders there.)

         Finally, ask whether the company's accounting practices are
     designed to make its financial results transparent--or opaque. If
     "nonrecurring" charges keep recurring, "extraordinary" items crop
     up so often that they seem ordinary, acronyms like EBITDA take
     priority over net income, or "pro forma" earnings are used to cloak
     actual losses, you may be looking at a firm that has not yet learned
     how to put its shareholders' long-term interests first.9

308  Commentary on Chapter 11

   Financial strength and capital structure. The most basic possible
definition of a good business is this: It generates more cash than it
consumes. Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to
productive use. In the long run, companies that meet this definition are
virtually certain to grow in value, no matter what the stock market
does.

   Start by reading the statement of cash flows in the company's
annual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily
throughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further. Warren Buffett
has popularized the concept of owner earnings, or net income plus
amortization and depreciation, minus normal capital expenditures. As
portfolio manager Christopher Davis of Davis Selected Advisors puts
it, "If you owned 100% of this business, how much cash would you
have in your pocket at the end of the year?" Because it adjusts for
accounting entries like amortization and depreciation that do not
affect the company's cash balances, owner earnings can be a better
measure than reported net income. To fine-tune the definition of owner
earnings, you should also subtract from reported net income:

· any costs of granting stock options, which divert earnings away
     from existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners

· any "unusual," "nonrecurring," or "extraordinary" charges
· any "income" from the company's pension fund.

   If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at
least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable gen-
erator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.

   Next, look at the company's capital structure. Turn to the balance
sheet to see how much debt (including preferred stock) the company
has; in general, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital.
In the footnotes to the financial statements, determine whether the
long-term debt is fixed-rate (with constant interest payments) or vari-
able (with payments that fluctuate, which could become costly if inter-
est rates rise).

   Look in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the
"ratio of earnings to fixed charges." That exhibit to Amazon.com's
2002 annual report shows that Amazon's earnings fell $145 million
short of covering its interest costs. In the future, Amazon will either
have to earn much more from its operations or find a way to borrow
money at lower rates. Otherwise, the company could end up being
Commentary on Chapter 11                                                309

owned not by its shareholders but by its bondholders, who can lay
claim to Amazon's assets if they have no other way of securing the
interest payments they are owed. (To be fair, Amazon's ratio of earn-
ings to fixed charges was far healthier in 2002 than two years earlier,
when earnings fell $1.1 billion short of covering debt payments.)

   A few words on dividends and stock policy (for more, please see
Chapter 19):

· The burden of proof is on the company to show that you are better
     off if it does not pay a dividend. If the firm has consistently outper-
     formed the competition in good markets and bad, the managers are
     clearly putting the cash to optimal use. If, however, business is fal-
     tering or the stock is underperforming its rivals, then the managers
     and directors are misusing the cash by refusing to pay a dividend.

· Companies that repeatedly split their shares--and hype those
     splits in breathless press releases--treat their investors like dolts.
     Like Yogi Berra, who wanted his pizza cut into four slices because
     "I don't think I can eat eight," the shareholders who love stock
     splits miss the point. Two shares of a stock at $50 are not worth
     more than one share at $100. Managers who use splits to pro-
     mote their stock are aiding and abetting the worst instincts of the
     investing public, and the intelligent investor will think twice before
     turning any money over to such condescending manipulators.10

· Companies should buy back their shares when they are cheap--
     not when they are at or near record highs. Unfortunately, it
     recently has become all too common for companies to repur-
     chase their stock when it is overpriced. There is no more cynical
     waste of a company's cash--since the real purpose of that maneu-
     ver is to enable top executives to reap multimillion-dollar paydays
     by selling their own stock options in the name of "enhancing
     shareholder value."

   A substantial amount of anecdotal evidence, in fact, suggests that
managers who talk about "enhancing shareholder value" seldom do.
In investing, as with life in general, ultimate victory usually goes to the
doers, not to the talkers.

Things to Consider About
Per-Share Earnings

This chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor

that cannot avoid being contradictory in their implications. The
first is: Don't take a single year's earnings seriously. The second is:
If you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby
traps in the per-share figures. If our first warning were followed
strictly the second would be unnecessary. But it is too much to
expect that most shareholders can relate all their common-stock
decisions to the long-term record and the long-term prospects. The
quarterly figures, and especially the annual figures, receive major
attention in financial circles, and this emphasis can hardly fail to
have its impact on the investor's thinking. He may well need some
education in this area, for it abounds in misleading possibilities.

   As this chapter is being written the earnings report of Alu-
minum Company of America (ALCOA) for 1970 appears in the
Wall Street Journal. The first figures shown are

Share earnings a  1970    1969
                  $5.20   $5.58

   The little a at the outset is explained in a footnote to refer to "pri-
mary earnings," before special charges. There is much more foot-
note material; in fact it occupies twice as much space as do the
basic figures themselves.

   For the December quarter alone, the "earnings per share" are
given as $1.58 in 1970 against $1.56 in 1969.

   The investor or speculator interested in ALCOA shares, reading

310
Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings                      311

those figures, might say to himself: "Not so bad. I knew that 1970
was a recession year in aluminum. But the fourth quarter shows a
gain over 1969, with earnings at the rate of $6.32 per year. Let me
see. The stock is selling at 62. Why, that's less than ten times earn-
ings. That makes it look pretty cheap, compared with 16 times for
International Nickel, etc., etc."

   But if our investor-speculator friend had bothered to read all the
material in the footnote, he would have found that instead of one
figure of earnings per share for the year 1970 there were actually
four, viz.:

Primary earnings                       1970               1969
Net income (after special charges)
Fully diluted, before special charges  $5.20              $5.58
Fully diluted, after special charges    4.32               5.58
                                        5.01               5.35
                                        4.19               5.35

For the fourth quarter alone only two figures are given:

Primary earnings                       $1.58              $1.56
Net income (after special charges)       .70               1.56

   What do all these additional earnings mean? Which earnings are
true earnings for the year and the December quarter? If the latter
should be taken at 70 cents--the net income after special charges--
the annual rate would be $2.80 instead of $6.32, and the price 62
would be "22 times earnings," instead of the 10 times we started
with.

   Part of the question as to the "true earnings" of ALCOA can be
answered quite easily. The reduction from $5.20 to $5.01, to allow
for the effects of "dilution," is clearly called for. ALCOA has a large
bond issue convertible into common stock; to calculate the "earn-
ing power" of the common, based on the 1970 results, it must be
assumed that the conversion privilege will be exercised if it should
prove profitable to the bondholders to do so. The amount involved
in the ALCOA picture is relatively small, and hardly deserves
detailed comment. But in other cases, making allowance for con-
version rights--and the existence of stock-purchase warrants--can
312  The Intelligent Investor

reduce the apparent earnings by half, or more. We shall present
examples of a really significant dilution factor below (page 411).
(The financial services are not always consistent in their allowance
for the dilution factor in their reporting and analyses.)*

   Let us turn now to the matter of "special charges." This figure of
$18,800,000, or 88 cents per share, deducted in the fourth quarter, is
not unimportant. Is it to be ignored entirely, or fully recognized as
an earnings reduction, or partly recognized and partly ignored?
The alert investor might ask himself also how does it happen that
there was a virtual epidemic of such special charge-offs appearing
after the close of 1970, but not in previous years? Could there pos-
sibly have been some fine Italian hands at work with the account-
ing--but always, of course, within the limits of the permissible?
When we look closely we may find that such losses, charged off
before they actually occur, can be charmed away, as it were, with
no unhappy effect on either past or future "primary earnings." In
some extreme cases they might be availed of to make subsequent
earnings appear nearly twice as large as in reality--by a more or
less prestidigitous treatment of the tax credit involved.

* "Dilution" is one of many words that describe stocks in the language of
fluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to be "liquid." When
a company goes public in an IPO, it "floats" its shares. And, in earlier days, a
company that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-
ible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have "watered"
its stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market
manipulator Daniel Drew (1797­1879), who began as a livestock trader. He
would drive his cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt
along the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge
volumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,
where the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That
enabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by
the pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning.
 Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant Italian
stone carvers who ornamented the otherwise plain facades of buildings
throughout New York in the early 1900s. Accountants, likewise, can trans-
form simple financial facts into intricate and even incomprehensible patterns.
Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings  313

   In dealing with ALCOA's special charges, the first thing to
establish is how they arose. The footnotes are specific enough. The
deductions came from four sources, viz.:

1. Management's estimate of the anticipated costs of closing
    down the manufactured products division.

2. Ditto for closing down ALCOA Castings Co.'s plants.
3. Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOA Credit Co.
4. Also, estimated costs of $5.3 million associated with comple-

    tion of the contract for a "curtain wall."

   All of these items are related to future costs and losses. It is easy
to say that they are not part of the "regular operating results" of
1970--but if so, where do they belong? Are they so "extraordinary
and nonrecurring" as to belong nowhere? A widespread enterprise
such as ALCOA, doing a $1.5 billion business annually, must have
a lot of divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not
be normal rather than extraordinary for one or more to prove
unprofitable, and to require closing down? Similarly for such
things as a contract to build a wall. Suppose that any time a com-
pany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of
charging it off as a "special item," and thus reporting its "primary
earnings" per share so as to include only its profitable contracts
and operations? Like King Edward VII's sundial, that marked only
the "sunny hours."*

* The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay by the
English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near Venice that
bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or "I count only the hours
that are serene." Companies that chronically exclude bad news from their
financial results on the pretext that negative events are "extraordinary" or
"nonrecurring" are taking a page from Hazlitt, who urged his readers "to
take no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and ne-
glect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments,
turning away to the sunny side of things, and letting the rest slip from our
imaginations, unheeded or forgotten!" (William Hazlitt, "On a Sun-Dial," ca.
1827.) Unfortunately, investors must always count the sunny and dark hours
alike.
314  The Intelligent Investor

   The reader should note two ingenious aspects of the ALCOA
procedure we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating
future losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the
losses themselves to an identifiable year. They don't belong in
1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they
won't be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because
they have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not
be just a little misleading?

   The ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving
from these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-
cally that only the "after-tax effect" has been charged off.) If the
ALCOA figure represents future losses before the related tax credit,
then not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these
charges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by
a tax credit of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the
accounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-
panies which have had large losses in the past have been able to
report future earnings without charging the
